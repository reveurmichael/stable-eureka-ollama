This environment is a classic rocket trajectory optimization problem. It is optimal to fire the engine at full throttle or turn it off. This is the reason why this environment has discrete actions: engine on or off.
The landing pad is always at coordinates (0,0). The coordinates are the first two numbers in the state vector. Landing outside of the landing pad is possible. Fuel is infinite, so an agent can learn to fly and then land on its first attempt.
The goal is to land at the pad.
Action Space: There are four discrete actions available:
    0: do nothing
    1: fire left orientation engine
    2: fire main engine
    3: fire right orientation engine
Observation Space: The state is an 8-dimensional vector: the coordinates of the lander in x & y, its linear velocities in x & y, its angle, its angular velocity, and two booleans that represent whether each leg is in contact with the ground or not.
