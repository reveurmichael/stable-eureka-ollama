```python
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    if not self.game_over and pos[0] > (TERRAIN_LENGTH - TERRAIN_GRASS) * TERRAIN_STEP:
        reward = np.exp((pos[0] - (TERRAIN_LENGTH - TERRAREN_GRASS)) / 50) - 1
    else:
        reward = 0.0

    individual_reward = {"reached_end": reward}

    return reward, individual_reward
```

Explanation: The goal is to reach the end of the terrain as fast as possible without getting stuck or falling down. We give a positive reward proportional to how close the agent is to the end, with a temperature parameter to smooth the reward curve. If the game is not over and the agent has reached the end, we give it a high reward.
