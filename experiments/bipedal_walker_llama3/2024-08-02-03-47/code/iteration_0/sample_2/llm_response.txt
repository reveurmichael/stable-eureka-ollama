```python
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    # Distance to the right end of terrain as a positive reward
    reach_distance = (TERRAIN_LENGTH - TERRAIN_GRASS) * TERRAIN_STEP - pos[0]
    reach_reward = np.exp(reach_distance / REACH_TEMPERATURE)

    # Penalty for falling down or getting stuck
    fall_penalty = 1.0 if pos[0] < 0 else 0.5 if any([l.fraction > 0.5 for l in self.lidar]) else 0.0

    # Smoothness bonus
    smooth_bonus = 1.0 - np.abs(state[2]) - np.abs(state[3])

    return reach_reward * (1.0 - fall_penalty) + smooth_bonus, {'reach_distance': reach_distance, 'fall_penalty': fall_penalty, 'smooth_bonus': smooth_bonus}
```
Explanation: This reward function aims to encourage the biped to move forward and avoid falling or getting stuck while traversing obstacles. It provides a positive reward for reaching the right end of the terrain, a penalty for falling down or getting stuck, and a bonus for maintaining a smooth movement.
