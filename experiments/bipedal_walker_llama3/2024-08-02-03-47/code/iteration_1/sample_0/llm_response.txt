```python
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    hull_position = pos[0]
    velocity = state[2]

    distance_reward = np.exp((TERRAIN_LENGTH - hull_position) / TERRAIN_STEP)
    speed_reward = np.exp(velocity)

    if self.game_over or hull_position < 0:
        done_reward = -10.0
    else:
        done_reward = 0.0

    reward = distance_reward * speed_reward + done_reward
    individual_rewards = {'distance': distance_reward, 'speed': speed_reward, 'done': done_reward}
    
    return reward, individual_rewards
```
The code calculates a reward based on the biped's progress and speed. The `distance_reward` is calculated as an exponential function of the distance from the start to the current position, with higher values for being closer to the end. The `speed_reward` is also an exponential function of the velocity, with higher values for faster movement. If the game is over or the biped has fallen off the terrain, a penalty is applied. The final reward is a combination of these three components.
