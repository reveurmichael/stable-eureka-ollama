    speed = state[2] * (VIEWPORT_W / SCALE) / FPS
    
    # Reward for reaching the end

    reward_components = {'reach_end': reach_end_reward}
    
    # Punish falling or getting stuck
    fall_punishment = -np.exp(-speed)  # Adjust temperature if needed
    reward_components['fall'] = fall_punishment
    
    # Reward for speed and movement
    speed_reward = np.exp(speed) * 0.5  # Adjust temperature if needed
    reward_components['speed'] = speed_reward
    
    total_reward, individual_rewards = 0, reward_components.copy()

```

Explanation: This code calculates a reward based on the distance to the target (the end of the terrain) and the current speed. The agent receives a reward for reaching the end, which is higher when closer to the target. It also receives a punishment for falling or getting stuck, which is stronger when the agent is not moving. Additionally, it receives a reward for its speed, with more reward given for faster movements.
