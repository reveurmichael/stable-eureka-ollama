```python
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    if not self.game_over:
        reward = -0.1 + 0.05 * (TERRAIN_LENGTH - TERRAIN_GRASS) * TERRAIN_STEP / abs(pos[0] - TERRAIN_LENGTH)
    else:
        reward = -100

    individual_reward = {'reach_end': 0.5 - 0.2 * pos[0], 'avoid_falling': -1 if state[12] or state[18] else 0, 'smoothness': -0.1}

    return reward, individual_reward
```

The reward function is designed to encourage the agent to reach the end of the terrain while avoiding falling and sticking in certain positions. The main components of the reward are:

* `reach_end`: A positive reward for moving towards the right end of the terrain.
* `avoid_falling`: A negative reward for falling or getting stuck, which discourages the agent from staying in a certain position.
* `smoothness`: A slight penalty for not moving smoothly, as the agent could decide to avoid falling down.

The temperature parameters are introduced through the np.exp transformation in the reach_end component. This allows the agent to learn more effectively and avoid local optima.
