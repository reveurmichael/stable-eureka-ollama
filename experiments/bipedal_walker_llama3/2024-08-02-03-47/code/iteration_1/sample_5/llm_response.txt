```python
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    hull_angle = state[0]
    speed_x = state[2]
    speed_y = state[3]

    # Reward for moving forward
    forward_reward = -10.0 * (1 + np.tanh(0.5 * speed_x))

    # Penalties for falling or getting stuck
    fall_penalty = -100.0 if pos[0] < 0 else 0
    stuck_penalty = -50.0 if hull_angle > 0.2 else 0

    # Penalty for not moving forward
    no_move_penalty = -10.0 * (1 + np.tanh(-speed_x))

    reward = self.temperature * (forward_reward + fall_penalty + stuck_penalty + no_move_penalty)

    individual_reward = {'forward_reward': forward_reward, 'fall_penalty': fall_penalty, 'stuck_penalty': stuck_penalty, 'no_move_penalty': no_move_penalty}

    return reward, individual_reward
```

This reward function aims to encourage the agent to move forward while avoiding falling and getting stuck. The forward reward is based on the agent's speed in the x-direction, with higher rewards for faster movement. Falling or getting stuck results in large penalties. Additionally, a small penalty is applied when the agent doesn't move forward.
