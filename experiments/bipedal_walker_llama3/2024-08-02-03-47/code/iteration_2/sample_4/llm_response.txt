This reward function aims to encourage the agent to move forward and reach the end of the terrain, while avoiding falling down or getting stuck. The base reward is calculated based on the agent's speed in the x-direction, its distance from the end, and a bonus for smoothness and stability. A penalty is added if the agent falls down or gets stuck, with a large negative value to discourage these behaviors.
