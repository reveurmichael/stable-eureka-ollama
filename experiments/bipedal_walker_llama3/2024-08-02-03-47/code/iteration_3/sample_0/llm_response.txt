The provided reward function aims to encourage the biped robot to reach the end of the terrain while moving as fast and smoothly as possible. The main components are:

1. **Reward for reaching the goal**: +10 when the robot reaches the right end of the terrain.
2. **Penalty for falling off**: -10 if the robot falls off the terrain or gets stuck.
3. **Distance-based reward**: +0.5 * exp(-2.5 * distance_to_goal) to encourage moving towards the goal.
4. **Penalty for rapid movements**: -0.05 * sum(abs(action)) to discourage sudden and aggressive movements, which may lead to falls or getting stuck.

This reward function aims to strike a balance between reaching the goal and avoiding penalties.
