```python
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    reward = -abs(action[0]) - abs(action[1]) - abs(action[2]) - abs(action[3])
    
    individual_reward = {'velocity_x': -state[6], 'velocity_y': -state[7], 
                          'distance_to_end': 10.0 - (pos[0] / (TERRAIN_LENGTH - TERRAIN_GRASS) * TERRAIN_STEP)}
    
    return reward, individual_reward
```
This code implements a reward function that encourages the biped to move forward by penalizing actions with high magnitude and rewarding progress towards the end of the terrain. The `reward` is calculated as the negative sum of the absolute values of the actions' components. The `individual_reward` dictionary contains three components: the negative velocities in the x- and y-directions, which discourage the biped from falling or moving backwards; and a term that rewards progress towards the end of the terrain, with higher rewards for closer proximity to the end.
