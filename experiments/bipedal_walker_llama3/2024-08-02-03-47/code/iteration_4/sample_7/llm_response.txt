Explanation: The reward function is designed to encourage the biped to reach the end of the terrain as fast as possible while avoiding falling down. It calculates a distance reward that decreases with the distance from the end, a stability reward that encourages stable movements by penalizing large actions, and a speed reward that rewards movement forward. A fall penalty is applied if the biped falls or gets stuck.
