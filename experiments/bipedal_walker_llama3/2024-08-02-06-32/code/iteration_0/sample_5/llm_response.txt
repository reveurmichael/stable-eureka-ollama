    if pos[0] > (TERRAIN_LENGTH - TERRAIN_GRASS) * TERRAIN_STEP:
        reward += 1.0
        individual_reward["reaching_end"] = 1.0

    if pos[0] < 0:
        reward -= 10.0
        individual_reward["falling_down"] = -10.0

    if state[11] == 1.0 or state[19] == 1.0:  # legs stuck
        reward -= 5.0
        individual_reward["getting_stuck"] = -5.0

    # encourage moving forward and reaching the end

```
Explanation: This code defines a reward function that incentivizes the agent to reach the end of the terrain, avoid falling down and getting stuck. The function assigns positive rewards for reaching the end and negative rewards for falling down or getting stuck. Additionally, it introduces an exponential reward term that encourages the agent to move forward and reach the end as quickly as possible.
