```python
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    x_position = pos[0]
    
    if x_position > (TERRAIN_LENGTH - TERRAIN_GRASS) * TERRAIN_STEP:
        total_reward = 100.0  # reach the end
        individual_rewards = {"end_reached": 100.0}
    elif self.game_over or x_position < 0:
        total_reward = -10.0  # fell down or got stuck
        individual_rewards = {"fell_down" : -10.0}
    else:
        total_reward = 1.0 - abs(2 * state[2] / FPS)  # negative reward for slow movement, more is better
        individual_rewards = {"speed": 1.0 - abs(2 * state[2] / FPS)}
    
    return total_reward, individual_rewards
```

This reward function encourages the agent to reach the end of the terrain by giving a high reward when it does. If the agent falls down or gets stuck, it receives a penalty. The speed at which the agent moves is also taken into account, with faster movement being rewarded and slower movement being penalized.
