```python
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    reward = 0.0
    individual_rewards = {}
    
    # Reach the end of terrain
    if pos[0] > (TERRAIN_LENGTH - TERRAIN_GRASS) * TERRAIN_STEP:
        reward += 10.0
    elif not self.game_over and pos[0] < 0:
        reward -= 5.0
    
    # Avoid falling down or getting stuck
    if state[-1] == 1.0:
        reward -= 2.0
    else:
        individual_rewards['forward_progress'] = 0.5 * (state[3] - state[4])
    
    # Maintain forward speed
    individual_rewards['speed'] = np.exp(action[0] ** 2) * 0.5
    
    return reward, individual_rewards
```

This code calculates a total reward value and a dictionary of individual reward components. The reward encourages the biped to reach the end of the terrain (positive reward for forward progress), avoid falling down or getting stuck (negative reward for lack of progress), and maintain forward speed (exp-based positive reward).
