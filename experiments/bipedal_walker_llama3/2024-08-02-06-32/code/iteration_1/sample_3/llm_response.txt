```python
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    distance_to_end = pos[0] / TERRAIN_LENGTH
    falling_punishment = 1 - (min(0.5, abs(pos[1])) + min(0.5, abs(pos[2])))
    speed_reward = max(action[0], 0) * SPEED_PENALTY
    stuck_penalty = int(any(state[-12:-6]) > 0.8)
    
    reward = (distance_to_end - falling_punishment) * EXPLORE_REWARD + speed_reward + stuck_penalty * PENALTY_STUCK
    return np.exp(reward / TEMPERATURE), {'distance_to_end': distance_to_end, 'falling_punishment': falling_punishment, 'speed_reward': speed_reward, 'stuck_penalty': stuck_penalty}
```

This reward function aims to balance the biped's movement towards the end of the terrain while avoiding falling down and getting stuck. The distance to the end is incentivized with a positive reward that decreases as the agent approaches the end. Falling down or getting stuck results in a penalty that increases exponentially with the TEMPERATURE parameter, encouraging the agent to avoid these states. The speed_reward term rewards the agent for moving forward quickly, while the stuck_penalty term penalizes the agent for getting stuck.
