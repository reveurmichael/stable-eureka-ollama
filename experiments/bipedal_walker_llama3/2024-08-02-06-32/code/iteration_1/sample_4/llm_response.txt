        reward, _ = self.penalty(-20, {"stuck": True})
    
    # Incentives for forward progress and speed
    if distance_to_end > TERRAIN_GRASS * TERRAIN_STEP:
        reward_components["progress"] = 10 + np.exp(0.5 * (distance_to_end - TERRAIN_GRASS * TERRAIN_STEP))
    else:
        reward_components["progress"] = -10

```

The reward function aims to encourage the biped to reach the end of the terrain while moving as fast as possible. It uses a combination of penalties and incentives to achieve this goal. The penalty for falling or getting stuck is high to discourage these behaviors, while the incentive for forward progress increases exponentially as the agent approaches the end of the terrain. Additionally, the speed reward motivates the agent to move quickly throughout the episode.
