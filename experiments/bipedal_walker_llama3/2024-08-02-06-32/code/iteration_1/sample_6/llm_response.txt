```python
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    hull_angle = state[0]
    x_vel = state[2]

    distance_to_goal = abs(pos[0] - TERRAIN_LENGTH)
    if self.game_over or pos[0] < 0:
        reward = -10.0
    else:
        reward = np.exp(-distance_to_goal / TERRAIN_LENGTH) * (1 + x_vel)

    individual_reward = {'hull_angle': hull_angle, 'x_velocity': x_vel}

    return reward, individual_reward
```

This code computes a reward that encourages the agent to reach the end of the terrain while avoiding falling down. The reward is based on the distance to the goal and the agent's velocity. When the game is over or the agent falls off the edge, the reward is -10.0. Otherwise, the reward is calculated as the exponential of the negative distance to the goal (to penalize being far from the end) plus the x-velocity (to encourage movement). The individual_reward dictionary provides additional information about the agent's state.
