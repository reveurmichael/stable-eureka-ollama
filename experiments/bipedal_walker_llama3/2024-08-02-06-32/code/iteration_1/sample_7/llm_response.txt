This reward function aims to encourage the biped to reach the end of the terrain while keeping it stable. The reward is calculated based on the biped's position and height. If the biped has reached the end of the terrain, it receives a positive reward. If it falls or gets stuck before reaching the end, it receives a negative reward. A temperature parameter is used to control the scaling of the rewards.
