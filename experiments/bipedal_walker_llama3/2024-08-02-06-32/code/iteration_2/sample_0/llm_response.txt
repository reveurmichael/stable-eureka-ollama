```python
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    reaching_goal = -0.1 * (1 - (pos[0] / TERRAIN_LENGTH))
    avoiding_falling = 0.2 if pos[1] > 0 else -10
    moving_forward = -0.5 * (action[0]**2 + action[1]**2)
    reward_components = {
        'reaching_goal': reaching_goal,
        'avoiding_falling': avoiding_falling,
        'moving_forward': moving_forward
    }
    return np.exp(np.sum(list(reward_components.values())) / 3.0), reward_components
```

Explanation: The goal is to make the biped reach the right end of the terrain and avoid falling down, getting stuck while surpassing obstacles (e.g., gaps, steps, stairs). To achieve this, the reward function includes three components:

1. 'reaching_goal': A negative reward that decreases as the biped approaches the right end of the terrain. This encourages the agent to move forward.
2. 'avoiding_falling': A positive reward when the biped is above ground (y > 0) and a large negative reward if it falls below ground (y <= 0). This discourages the agent from falling down.
3. 'moving_forward': A negative reward that decreases as the agent moves forward. This encourages the agent to keep moving.

The rewards are then normalized using an exponential transformation with a temperature parameter set to 1/3, which gives more weight to the 'reaching_goal' component.
