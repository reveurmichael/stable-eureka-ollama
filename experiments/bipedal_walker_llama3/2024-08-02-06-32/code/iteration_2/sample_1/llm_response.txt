        # Agent is moving forward
        if abs(action[0]) + abs(action[1]) > 0.5 and action[2] == 0 and action[3] == 0:
            return 1.0, {'moving_forward': True}

This reward function aims to encourage the biped to move forward towards the end of the terrain while avoiding falling down or getting stuck. It assigns a high reward when the agent reaches the end of the terrain, and a low penalty when it falls down or gets stuck in one position. The function also rewards the agent for moving forward by giving a positive reward if its joints are not static and its speed is above a certain threshold.
