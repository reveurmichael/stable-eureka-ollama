```python
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    done = pos[0] < 0 or self.game_over
    reward = -1 if not done else 10 + (pos[0] - TERRAIN_LENGTH) / TERRAIN_STEP  # reaching the end
    individual_reward = {"reached_end": -1 if not done else 10 + (pos[0] - TERRAIN_LENGTH) / TERRAIN_STEP,
                          "moving_forward": np.exp(-abs(action).sum() * 2)  # moving forward is good
                         }
    return reward, individual_reward
```

This reward function encourages the agent to reach the end of the terrain while penalizing it for not making progress. The reward is negative when the agent hasn't reached the end yet, and it increases as the agent approaches the end.
