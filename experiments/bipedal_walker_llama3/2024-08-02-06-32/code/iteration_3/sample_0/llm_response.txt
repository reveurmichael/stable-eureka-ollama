```python
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    reach_end = int(pos[0] > (TERRAIN_LENGTH - TERRAIN_GRASS) * TERRAIN_STEP)
    fall_down = int(1.5 < pos[1])  # assuming the agent falls down when y-coordinate is above 1.5
    stuck = int((pos[0] - self.scroll) ** 2 + (pos[1] - 3.4) ** 2 > 0.01)
    
    reward = -abs(action).sum() * 0.001  # penalize high movements
    individual_reward = {'reach_end': reach_end, 'fall_down': fall_down, 'stuck': stuck}
    
    return -1 if reach_end else 10 + (5 if not fall_down and not stuck else 0), individual_reward
```

This reward function encourages the agent to move towards the end of the terrain while avoiding falling down or getting stuck. The negative reward for high movements helps the agent to move efficiently and quickly.
