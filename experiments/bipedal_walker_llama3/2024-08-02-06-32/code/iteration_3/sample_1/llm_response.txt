```python
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    reward = 0.0
    individual_rewards = {}
    
    # Encourage movement towards the right end of the terrain
    if pos[0] > TERRAIN_LENGTH / 2:
        reward += 0.1
    
    # Penalty for falling or getting stuck
    if self.game_over or not all(l.ground_contact for l in self.legs):
        reward -= 10.0
    
    # Encourage speed and movement
    reward += np.clip(action[0] + action[2], -1, 1) * 0.1
    
    individual_rewards['progress'] = (pos[0] > TERRAIN_LENGTH / 2)
    individual_rewards['stability'] = not self.game_over and all(l.ground_contact for l in self.legs)
    individual_rewards['speed'] = np.clip(action[0] + action[2], -1, 1) * 0.1
    
    return reward, individual_rewards
```

This reward function encourages the agent to move towards the right end of the terrain by rewarding progress. It also penalizes the agent for falling or getting stuck and encourages speed and movement by awarding a small bonus for each step taken. The `individual_rewards` dictionary provides a breakdown of these rewards, allowing for more detailed analysis and tuning.
