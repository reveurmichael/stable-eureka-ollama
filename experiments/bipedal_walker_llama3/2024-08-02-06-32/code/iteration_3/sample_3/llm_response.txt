```python
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    distance_reached = (TERRAIN_LENGTH - TERRAIN_GRASS) * TERRAIN_STEP - pos[0]
    
    if self.game_over or pos[0] < 0:
        reward = -10.0  # penalty for game over or falling
    else:
        reward = np.exp((distance_reached / (TERRAIN_LENGTH - TERRAIN_GRASS)) * temperature)  # exponential distance reward
        
        if not self.game_over:  # if the agent hasn't reached the end yet
            reward *= 0.9 + 0.1 * (state[2] ** 2 + state[3] ** 2)  # bonus for speed and direction
            
    return np.exp(reward), {'distance': np.exp((distance_reached / (TERRAIN_LENGTH - TERRAIN_GRASS)) * temperature)}
```

Explanation: The reward function is designed to encourage the agent to reach the end of the terrain as fast as possible. A penalty is given for game over or falling, and an exponential reward is given based on the distance reached from the start. Additionally, a bonus is given for speed and direction if the agent hasn't yet reached the end, which encourages it to move forward and avoid falling down. The temperature parameter allows for tuning of the importance of each component in the reward function.
