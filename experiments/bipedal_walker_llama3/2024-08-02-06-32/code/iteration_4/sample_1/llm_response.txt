```python
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    reward = -1 * (abs(pos[0] - TERRAIN_LENGTH) + abs(action[0]) + abs(action[2])) ** 0.5  # penalize position and movement
    individual_reward = {'movement': -1 * (action[0] ** 2 + action[2] ** 2), 'position': -1 * (pos[0] - TERRAIN_LENGTH) ** 0.5}
    return reward, individual_reward
```

Explanation: The goal is to make the biped navigate the terrain while avoiding falling down and getting stuck. This reward function encourages movement towards the end of the terrain by penalizing the position and movement. The more the agent moves away from the end, the greater the penalty. The movement component also rewards or penalizes the action taken by the agent, depending on its magnitude.
