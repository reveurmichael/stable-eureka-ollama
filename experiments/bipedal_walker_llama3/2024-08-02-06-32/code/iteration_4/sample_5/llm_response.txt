```python
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    velocity = state[2]
    if self.game_over or pos[0] < 0:
        reward = -1.0
        individual_reward = {'game_over': -1.0}
    else:
        reward = np.exp((TERRAIN_LENGTH - pos[0]) / TERRAIN_STEP) * (velocity + 1)
        individual_reward = {'progress': np.exp((TERRAIN_LENGTH - pos[0]) / TERRAIN_STEP), 'velocity': velocity}

    return reward, individual_reward
```

Explanation:
The goal is to create a reward function that encourages the biped to reach the end of the terrain and move as fast as possible. The reward is composed of two components: progress towards the end of the terrain (measured by the position along the terrain) and velocity. The progress component increases exponentially with distance from the start, while the velocity component adds a bonus for faster movement. If the game is over or the biped has fallen off the terrain, a penalty is applied to discourage such behaviors.
