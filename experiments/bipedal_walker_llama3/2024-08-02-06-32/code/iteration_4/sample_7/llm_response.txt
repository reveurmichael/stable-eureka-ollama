    smoothness_penalty = 1.0 - np.abs(hull_angle) - np.abs(velocity_x)

```

This reward function aims to encourage the agent to move forward and avoid falling down while being as smooth as possible. The "forward" component rewards the distance traveled towards the end of the terrain. The "fall" penalty is triggered when the agent falls (i.e., its vertical velocity is negative). The "smoothness" component rewards the agent for maintaining a stable position and moving smoothly, with more emphasis on being still than moving quickly. Finally, the "speed" component provides a bonus for fast movement, scaled by the agent's hip and knee actions.
