```python
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    reward = 0.0
    individual_rewards = {}
    
    # Positive reward for moving forward
    if pos[0] > self.scroll:
        reward += 1.0 / (1 + np.exp(-10 * (pos[0] - self.scroll)))
        individual_rewards['forward_reward'] = 1.0 / (1 + np.exp(-10 * (pos[0] - self.scroll)))
    
    # Negative penalty for falling down
    if pos[0] < 0:
        reward -= 100.0
        individual_rewards['falling_penalty'] = -100.0
    
    # Negative penalty for not moving forward
    if abs(pos[0] - self.scroll) < 0.1 and action[0] == 0:
        reward -= 10.0
        individual_rewards['standstill_penalty'] = -10.0
    
    return reward, individual_rewards
```

This reward function encourages the biped to move forward (positive reward), while penalizing it for falling down (negative penalty) or not making progress (negative penalty). The exponential transformation helps to scale the rewards and penalties smoothly.
