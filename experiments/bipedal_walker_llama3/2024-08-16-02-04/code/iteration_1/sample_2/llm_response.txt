```python
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    done = state[0] > (TERRAIN_LENGTH - TERRAIN_GRASS) * TERRAIN_STEP
    reaching_goal = pos[0] > (TERRAIN_LENGTH - TERRAIN_GRASS) * TERRAIN_STEP
    falling_down = state[2] < -1.0 or state[3] < -1.0
    
    reward = 0
    
    if reaching_goal:
        reward += 10.0
    elif not done and not falling_down:
        reward -= 0.05

    individual_reward = {
        'reaching_goal': 10.0 * (reaching_goal - 0.5),
        'progress': -0.05,
        'avoid_falling': -2.0 * (falling_down - 0.5)
    }
    
    return reward, individual_reward
```

Explanation: The reward function is designed to encourage the agent to reach the goal, avoid falling down and make progress along the terrain. A positive reward is given when the agent reaches the goal, while a negative reward is given for every step taken without reaching the goal. If the agent falls down, it receives an even lower reward to discourage this behavior. The individual rewards are normalized between -1 and 1 using the np.exp function with a temperature parameter of 10.0.
