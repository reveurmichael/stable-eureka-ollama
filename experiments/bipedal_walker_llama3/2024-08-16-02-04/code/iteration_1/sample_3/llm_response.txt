```python
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    reward = 0.0
    individual_reward = {}
    
    # positive reward for forward movement and negative reward for backward movement
    if pos[0] > self.scroll:
        reward += 10.0 * (1 - math.exp(-(pos[0] - self.scroll) / 5))
    else:
        reward -= 2.0 * math.exp((self.scroll - pos[0]) / 3)
    
    # penalty for falling
    if not self.legs[1].ground_contact and not self.legs[3].ground_contact:
        reward -= 20
    
    individual_reward['forward'] = 10.0 * (1 - math.exp(-(pos[0] - self.scroll) / 5))
    individual_reward['backward'] = 2.0 * math.exp((self.scroll - pos[0]) / 3)
    individual_reward['falling'] = -20
    
    return reward, individual_reward
```

This code aims to encourage the agent to move forward and reach the end of the terrain as quickly as possible, while avoiding falling down. The reward is calculated based on the agent's position and contact with the ground. A positive reward is given for each step taken forward, while a negative reward is given for each step taken backward or when the agent is not grounded. Additionally, a large penalty is given when the agent falls.
