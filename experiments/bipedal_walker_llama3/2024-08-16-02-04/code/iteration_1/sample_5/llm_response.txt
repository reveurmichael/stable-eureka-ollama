    # Penalty for falling or getting stuck
    if pos[0] < 0:
        reward_component2 = -np.exp(5.0)
    else:
        reward_component2 = 0.0
    
    # Penalty for not moving
    if velocity < 0.1:
        reward_component3 = -np.exp(3.0)
    else:
        reward_component3 = 0.0

Explanation: The goal is to encourage the biped to move forward and reach the end of the terrain while avoiding falling or getting stuck. We use a combination of rewards and penalties for this. A positive reward is given for moving forward (distance-based) and increasing velocity, with an exponential increase in the reward as the agent moves closer to the end. A penalty is given for falling off the edge, which strongly discourages this behavior. Additionally, a small penalty is given if the agent does not move at all, encouraging it to continue making progress.
