    # Reward for moving forward
    reward_components['forward_progress'] = np.tanh(velocity_x * 5)

    # Penalty for falling or being stuck
    if pos[0] < 0:
        reward_components['fall_penalty'] = -10
    elif distance_traveled > TERRAIN_LENGTH / 2:
        reward_components['stickiness_penalty'] = -5

    # Reward for reaching the end of the terrain
    if pos[0] > (TERRAIN_LENGTH - TERRAIN_GRASS) * TERRAIN_STEP:

```

Explanation: The reward function incentivizes the agent to move forward by rewarding its velocity and distance traveled. It also penalizes the agent for falling or being stuck in a certain position. Additionally, it provides a bonus when the agent reaches the end of the terrain. The rewards are normalized using exponential transformation with a temperature parameter.
