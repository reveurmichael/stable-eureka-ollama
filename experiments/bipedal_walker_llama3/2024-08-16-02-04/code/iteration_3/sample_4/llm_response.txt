    x_pos = pos[0]
    reward = 1.0 - np.exp(-5 * ((TERRAIN_LENGTH - TERRAIN_GRASS) - x_pos) / (TERRAIN_LENGTH - TERRAIN_GRASS))
    individual_reward = {"pos": reward}
    
    if self.game_over or x_pos < 0:
        reward -= 10
        individual_reward["game_over"] = 1.0

Explanation: The reward is designed to encourage the biped to move forward and reach the end of the terrain as quickly as possible while avoiding getting stuck or falling down. It starts with a high value for being at the start of the terrain and decreases exponentially as the biped moves closer to the end. If the game is over or the biped falls off the left side, it receives a penalty. The reward also includes a term that encourages smooth movement by penalizing large motor actions.
