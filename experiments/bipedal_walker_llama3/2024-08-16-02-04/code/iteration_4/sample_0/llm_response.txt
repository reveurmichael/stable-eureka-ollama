```python
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    distance_reached = abs(pos[0] - TERRAIN_LENGTH) / TERRAIN_LENGTH
    height_error = abs(state[0] * (VIEWPORT_H / SCALE))
    speed = max(abs(action[0]), abs(action[2]))
    falling = 1.0 if pos[1] < 0 else 0.0
    
    reward = -abs(height_error) - 0.5 * distance_reached + 0.05 * speed + 0.1 * falling
    individual_reward = {'distance': -distance_reached, 'height': -height_error, 'speed': 0.05 * speed, 'falling': 0.1 * falling}
    
    return reward, individual_reward
```
The reward function encourages the agent to move forward (reaches more distance), maintain a stable height (minimizes height error), and stay fast (maximizes speed). However, it also penalizes the agent for falling down by increasing the negative reward. This trade-off helps the agent learn to balance its movement with stability.
