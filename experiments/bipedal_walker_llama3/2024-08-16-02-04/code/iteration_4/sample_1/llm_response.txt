This reward function is designed to encourage the biped to reach the end of the terrain while avoiding falling down and moving forward as much as possible. The `reach_end` component rewards the agent for reaching the end of the terrain, the `avoid_falling` component penalizes the agent for falling off the terrain, and the `move_forward` component encourages the agent to move forward by taking non-zero actions.
