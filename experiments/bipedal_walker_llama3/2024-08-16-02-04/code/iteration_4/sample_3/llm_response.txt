Explanation: The reward function is designed to encourage the agent to reach the goal as fast as possible while avoiding falling and being super smooth. It consists of four components:

*   `distance_to_goal`: This component encourages the agent to move forward by decreasing with increasing distance to the goal.
*   `falling`: If the agent falls, this component decreases the reward by a large amount (10).
*   `moving_forward`: This component rewards the agent for moving forward by 0.5 units every 20 steps.
*   `smoothness`: The smoothness of movement is encouraged by giving a small reward (0.5) if the agent moves smoothly and doesn't fall.
