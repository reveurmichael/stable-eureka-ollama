```python
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    reward = 0.0
    individual_reward = {}
    
    # Reward for reaching the end of the terrain
    if pos[0] > (TERRAIN_LENGTH - TERRAIN_GRASS) * TERRAIN_STEP:
        reward += 10.0
        individual_reward['end_reached'] = 10.0
    
    # Penalty for falling down
    if self.game_over:
        reward -= 5.0
        individual_reward['fell_down'] = -5.0
    
    # Reward for moving forward
    reward += 0.1 * (VIEWPORT_W / SCALE)
    individual_reward['forward_movement'] = 0.1 * (VIEWPORT_W / SCALE)
    
    return reward, individual_reward
```
This reward function provides a combination of rewards and penalties to guide the agent towards its goal. It incentivizes the agent to reach the end of the terrain by providing a large reward when it does so. At the same time, it penalizes the agent for falling down, which is undesirable behavior. Additionally, it provides a small reward for each step forward the agent takes, encouraging it to move in the right direction.
