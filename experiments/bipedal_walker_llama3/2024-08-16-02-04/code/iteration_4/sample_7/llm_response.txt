```python

    velocity = state[2]
    position_diff = pos[0] - self.prev_pos[0]

    if abs(velocity) > 0.5 and not self.game_over:
        # Positive reward for moving forward
        reward = np.exp(position_diff / TERRAIN_STEP)
    elif self.game_over or pos[0] < 0:
        # Penalty for falling or game over
        reward = -np.exp(-1)
    else:
        # No reward for standing still
        reward = 0

Explanation: The reward function is designed to encourage the biped to move forward and reach the end of the terrain. It rewards positive velocity (moving forward) with an exponential growth based on the distance traveled. If the biped falls or the game is over, it penalizes with a negative reward.
