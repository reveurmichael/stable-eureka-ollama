```python
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    distance_reached = (pos[0] - TERRAIN_LENGTH) / (TERRAIN_LENGTH * TERRAIN_STEP)
    speed = abs(state[2]) + abs(state[3])
    
    reward = -1.0 + 0.5 * np.exp(-temperature_distance * distance_reached) + temperature_speed * np.exp(-temperature_speed * speed)
    
    individual_reward = {'distance': -1.0 + 0.5 * np.exp(-temperature_distance * distance_reached), 'speed': temperature_speed * np.exp(-temperature_temperature_speed * speed)}
    
    return reward, individual_reward
```

This code calculates a reward that encourages the agent to move forward and reach the end of the terrain as quickly as possible. The reward is composed of two components: distance reached and speed. Distance reached is calculated by comparing the current position with the end of the terrain, and it's rewarded positively using an exponential transformation. Speed is calculated by summing the absolute values of the x-velocities (state[2] and state[3]) and it's also rewarded positively using another exponential transformation. The temperature parameters control the importance of each component in the reward function.
