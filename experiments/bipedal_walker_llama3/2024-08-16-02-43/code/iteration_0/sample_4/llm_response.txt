```python
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    reward = -1 * (len(action) / TERRAIN_LENGTH)
    individual_reward = {'distance_reached': len(action) / TERRAIN_LENGTH}
    
    if pos[0] < 0:
        reward -= 100
        individual_reward['fell_down'] = 100
    elif self.game_over or pos[0] > (TERRAIN_LENGTH - TERRAIN_GRASS) * TERRAIN_STEP:
        reward += 10
        individual_reward['reached_end'] = 10
    
    return reward, individual_reward
```
This code calculates a reward that is negative for each step taken, which encourages the agent to move forward quickly. If the agent falls off the terrain or reaches the end, it receives a larger positive reward. The individual_reward dictionary keeps track of these specific events.
