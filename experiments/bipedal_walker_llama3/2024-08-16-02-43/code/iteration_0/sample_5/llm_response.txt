```python
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    distance_reached = pos[0] / (TERRAIN_LENGTH - TERRAIN_GRASS)
    speed_reward = np.tanh(state[3]) * 10.0
    stability_reward = 1.0 - np.abs(state[2])
    falling_penalty = int(pos[1] < 0) * 5.0
    stuck_penalty = int(any(x for x in state[11:14])) * 5.0

    reward = (distance_reached + speed_reward) * 10.0 - stability_reward - falling_penalty - stuck_penalty
    individual_reward = {
        'distance': distance_reached,
        'speed': speed_reward,
        'stability': stability_reward,
        'falling': falling_penalty,
        'stuck': stuck_penalty
    }
    return reward, individual_reward
```

Explanation: The compute_reward function calculates the total reward based on the distance reached by the biped, its speed, and stability. A penalty is applied if the biped falls or gets stuck. The reward is a combination of these components to encourage the agent to move forward as fast as possible while avoiding falling down and getting stuck.
