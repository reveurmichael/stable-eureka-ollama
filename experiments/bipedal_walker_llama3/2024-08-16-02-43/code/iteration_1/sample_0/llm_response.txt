```python
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    hull_angle = state[0]
    angular_velocity = state[1]
    x_velocity = state[2]
    y_velocity = state[3]
    
    reward = -0.1 * (np.abs(hull_angle) + np.abs(angular_velocity))  # penalize for not being upright
    reward -= 0.05 * (np.abs(x_velocity) + np.abs(y_velocity))  # penalize for moving slowly
    reward += 0.01 * state[4]  # reward for making progress along the x-axis
    
    return reward, {'hull_angle': hull_angle, 'angular_velocity': angular_velocity, 'x_velocity': x_velocity}
```

This reward function encourages the agent to maintain a stable upright position (penalizing deviations from the initial angle), move at a reasonable speed (penalizing slow movements), and make progress along the x-axis (rewards for forward movement). The weights of these components are adjusted to balance the trade-off between stability, speed, and progress.
