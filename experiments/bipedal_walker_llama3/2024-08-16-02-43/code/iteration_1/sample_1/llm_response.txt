```python

    hull_angle = state[0]
    hip_angles = [state[4], state[8]]
    knee_angles = [state[5], state[9]]
    
    # Reward for reaching the end of the terrain
    reach_reward = np.exp((pos[0] - TERRAIN_LENGTH + TERRAIN_GRASS) * TERRAIN_STEP / 10.0)
    
    # Penalty for falling down or getting stuck
    penalty = 1.0 - np.exp(-abs(pos[0]) / 5.0)
    
    # Reward for moving forward and avoiding obstacles
    movement_reward = np.exp((VIEWPORT_W / SCALE) * state[2] / FPS / 10.0)
    
    # Smoothness of the biped's movement
    smoothness = 1.0 - np.sum([abs(angle) for angle in hip_angles + knee_angles]) / len(hip_angles + knee_angles)
    
    # Total reward
    total_reward = reach_reward * temperature * (1 - penalty) * movement_reward * smoothness
    
    return total_reward, {'reach': reach_reward, 'penalty': penalty, 'movement': movement_reward, 'smoothness': smoothness}
```

This reward function encourages the agent to move forward and avoid obstacles while reaching the end of the terrain. The reach reward is given for each step towards the end, with a higher value for closer proximity. A penalty is applied for falling down or getting stuck. The movement reward promotes smooth motion by awarding the agent for each step taken.
