```python
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    hull_angle = (state[0] + 1.57) / 3.14  # Normalize to get a value between 0 and 1
    speed_reward = np.exp((state[2] + state[4] + state[8]) * 0.01) - 1  # Temperature: 0.01

    if pos[0] < 0:
        reward = -10  # Punish for falling off the terrain
    elif hull_angle > 0.5 or hull_angle < -0.5:  # If the biped is leaning too much, punish it
        reward = -1
    else:
        reward = speed_reward

    individual_reward = {'speed': speed_reward, 'falling_off_terrain': -10 if pos[0] < 0 else 0}

    return reward, individual_reward
```

This reward function aims to encourage the biped to move forward and avoid falling off the terrain. The `speed_reward` term rewards the agent for moving quickly and smoothly, while the `falling_off_terrain` term penalizes it for falling off the terrain.
