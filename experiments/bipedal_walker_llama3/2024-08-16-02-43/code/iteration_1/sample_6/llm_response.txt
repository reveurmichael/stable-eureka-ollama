        if pos[0] > (TERRAIN_LENGTH - TERRAIN_GRASS) * TERRAIN_STEP:
            total_reward += 500.0

    # penalty for getting stuck
    if state[-1] == 1.0 and state[10:] == [1.0]*14:
        total_reward -= 100.0

    # reward for moving forward
    total_reward += 5.0 * (abs(action[0]) + abs(action[2]))

    individual_rewards['reach_end'] = 500.0 if pos[0] > (TERRAIN_LENGTH - TERRAIN_GRASS) * TERRAIN_STEP else 0.0
    individual_rewards['avoid_falling'] = -1000.0 if self.game_over else 0.0
    individual_rewards['avoid_getting_stuck'] = -100.0 if state[-1] == 1.0 and state[10:] == [1.0]*14 else 0.0

    return total_reward, individual_rewards
```

This reward function encourages the biped to reach the end of the terrain while avoiding falling down and getting stuck in a certain position. It also rewards the agent for moving forward. The penalties for falling down and getting stuck are high to ensure the agent prioritizes reaching the end and moving forward.
