```python
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    reward = 0.0
    individual_reward = {}
    
    # penalty for falling down or getting stuck
    if pos[0] < 0 or any(l.ground_contact for l in self.legs):
        reward -= 1.0
    else:
        # reward for moving forward and avoiding obstacles
        reward += 0.05 * (TERRAIN_LENGTH - pos[0]) / TERRAIN_STEP
        
    individual_reward['forward_progress'] = reward
    
    return reward, individual_reward
```

Explanation: This reward function aims to encourage the biped to move forward while avoiding falling down or getting stuck. It penalizes the agent for falling or getting stuck and rewards it for progressing towards the right end of the terrain. The reward is proportional to the distance from the starting point, with a smaller increment per step as the agent progresses.
