```python
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    terminal = pos[0] > (TERRAIN_LENGTH - TERRAIN_GRASS) * TERRAIN_STEP or self.game_over
    distance_from_end = max(0, (TERRAIN_LENGTH - TERRAIN_GRASS) * TERRAIN_STEP - pos[0])
    
    speed_reward = np.exp((state[2] + state[3]) / 10.0)  # exponential reward for high speed
    stability_reward = 1.0 if abs(state[0]) < 0.5 else 0.0  # bonus for stable legs
    
    reward = -1.0 if terminal else -np.exp(-distance_from_end / TERRAIN_LENGTH)
    
    individual_reward = {'speed': speed_reward, 'stability': stability_reward, 'distance': np.exp(-distance_from_end / TERRAIN_LENGTH)}
    return reward, individual_reward
```

This reward function aims to encourage the agent to move forward as quickly and stably as possible while reaching the end of the terrain. The main components of the reward are:

- A penalty for not reaching the end (negative exponential decay with distance from the end).
- Incentives for high speed (exponential reward based on the absolute value of the horizontal velocity) and stability (bonus if the legs are stable, i.e., within a small angle range).
