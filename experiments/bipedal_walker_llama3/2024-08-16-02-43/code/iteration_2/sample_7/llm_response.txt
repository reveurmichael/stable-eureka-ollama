```python
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    distance_to_end = TERRAIN_LENGTH - pos[0] * TERRAIN_STEP
    vertical_velocity = vel.y * (VIEWPORT_H / SCALE) / FPS
    forward_speed = 0.3 * vel.x * (VIEWPORT_W / SCALE) / FPS

    reward = distance_to_end + np.exp(forward_speed - 1)
    individual_reward = {"distance_to_end": distance_to_end, "forward_speed": forward_speed}

    return reward, individual_reward
```

Explanation: The reward function encourages the agent to move towards the end of the terrain (rewarded by `distance_to_end`) and maintain a reasonable speed (`forward_speed`). The exponential transformation on `forward_speed` introduces a temperature parameter, allowing the agent to trade off between distance and speed.
