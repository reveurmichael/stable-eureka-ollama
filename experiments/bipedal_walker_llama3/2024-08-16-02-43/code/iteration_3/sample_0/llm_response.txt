```python
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    reward = 0.0
    individual_reward = {}

    # Reward for reaching the end
    reward += (1 - (pos[0] / TERRAIN_LENGTH)) * 10.0

    # Penalty for falling down
    if pos[0] < 0:
        reward -= 5.0

    # Penalty for not moving forward
    if action[0] == 0 and action[2] == 0:
        reward -= 1.0

    individual_reward['reach_end'] = (1 - (pos[0] / TERRAIN_LENGTH)) * 10.0
    individual_reward['fall_down'] = -5.0 if pos[0] < 0 else 0.0
    individual_reward['no_move'] = -1.0 if action[0] == 0 and action[2] == 0 else 0.0

    return reward, individual_reward
```

Explanation: The goal is to make the biped navigate a 2D environment by reaching the end of the terrain while avoiding falling down or getting stuck. We use a combination of rewards and penalties to achieve this. The main reward is for reaching the end, with a higher reward at the start and decreasing as the agent progresses. A penalty is given for falling down, and another one for not moving forward.
