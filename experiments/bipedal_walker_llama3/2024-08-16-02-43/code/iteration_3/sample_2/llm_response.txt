```python
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    reward = 0.1 * (pos[0] > (TERRAIN_LENGTH - TERRAIN_GRASS) * TERRAIN_STEP)
    individual_reward = {"reached_goal": reward}
    
    if not self.game_over:
        reward -= 0.05 * abs(action[0]) + 0.01 * abs(action[1])
        individual_reward["penalty"] = reward
    else:
        individual_reward["game_over"] = 1.0
    
    return -reward, individual_reward
```

This reward function aims to encourage the biped to reach the right end of the terrain while minimizing unnecessary movements and avoiding getting stuck or falling down. The main components are: 

- A positive reward for reaching the goal, which is proportional to how far the biped has moved towards the goal.
- A penalty term that discourages large movements (i.e., actions with high magnitude), as these can lead to instability and increased risk of failure.
- In case of game over or falling down, a strong negative reward is given to encourage the agent to recover from such situations.

The individual_reward dictionary allows for easy tracking of the different components contributing to the total reward.
