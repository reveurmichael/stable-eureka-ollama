```python
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    distance_reward = (1 - (pos[0] / TERRAIN_LENGTH)) * REWARD_MAX_DISTANCE
    speed_reward = action[0] * REWARD_SPEED
    angle_reward = abs(state[0]) * REWARD_ANGLE
    terrain_reward = 1 if pos[0] > (TERRAIN_LENGTH - TERRAIN_GRASS) * TERRAIN_STEP else 0
    stability_reward = np.exp(-abs(action[0])) * REWARD_STABILITY
    reward = distance_reward + speed_reward + angle_reward + terrain_reward - stability_reward
    return reward, {'distance': distance_reward, 'speed': speed_reward, 'angle': angle_reward, 'terrain': terrain_reward, 'stability': -stability_reward}
```

This reward function encourages the agent to move forward as quickly and smoothly as possible while avoiding falling down or getting stuck. The distance reward decreases as the agent moves closer to the end of the terrain, the speed reward increases with the agent's velocity, the angle reward penalizes large deviations from the horizontal position, the terrain reward gives a bonus when the agent reaches the end of the terrain, and the stability reward encourages smooth movements by reducing the penalty for small actions.
