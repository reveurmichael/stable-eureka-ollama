```python
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    reward = 0.5 - np.abs(pos[0]) / (TERRAIN_LENGTH / 2)
    reward += 1e-3 * np.sum(np.square(action))
    
    individual_reward = {'pos': reward}
    
    return reward, individual_reward
```

Explanation: The main goal is to reach the end of the terrain while avoiding falling down. To achieve this, we encourage the agent to move forward by giving it a positive reward proportional to its distance from the left edge of the terrain. At the same time, we penalize large actions by adding a small term based on the square of each action component. This encourages the agent to move smoothly and avoid taking large steps that could lead to falling or getting stuck.
