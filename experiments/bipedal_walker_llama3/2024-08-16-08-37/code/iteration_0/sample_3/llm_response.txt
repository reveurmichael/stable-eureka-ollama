```python
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    hull_angle = state[0]
    x_velocity = state[2]

    # Reward for moving forward (faster the better)
    move_reward = np.exp(2 * x_velocity)

    # Punish falling or stuck in place
    fall_punishment = np.exp(-10 * abs(hull_angle))
    
    # Encourage reaching end of terrain
    reach_reward = np.exp(5 * (1 - (pos[0] / TERRAIN_LENGTH)))

    reward = move_reward + reach_reward - fall_punishment

    individual_reward = {'move': move_reward, 'reach': reach_reward, 'fall': fall_punishment}

    return reward, individual_reward
```
Explanation: This function provides a simple yet effective reward structure for the biped agent. The main components of the reward are:
- Moving forward (x_velocity > 0) with faster movements being better (exponential increase with speed)
- Punishing falling or stuck in place by having a negative exponential relationship between hull angle and the reward
- Rewarding reaching the end of the terrain with an exponential increase as the biped approaches the goal
