This reward function aims to encourage the biped to reach the end of the terrain while avoiding falling down and staying active. It provides a high reward for reaching the end of the terrain, a punishment for falling down, a reward for moving forward, and a penalty for not moving at all. The rewards are calculated using exponential transformations with temperature parameters to smooth out the rewards.
