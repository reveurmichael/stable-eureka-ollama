```python
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    reward = -1.0 * len(action)
    individual_reward = {'movement_reward': -1.0 * len(action)}
    
    if self.game_over or pos[0] < 0:
        reward += -100.0
        individual_reward.update({'failure_penalty': -100.0})
        
    elif pos[0] > (TERRAIN_LENGTH - TERRAIN_GRASS) * TERRAIN_STEP:
        reward += 100.0
        individual_reward.update({'success_reward': 100.0})
        
    return np.exp(reward), individual_reward
```
This reward function aims to encourage the agent to move forward while avoiding failure and reaching the end of the terrain as quickly as possible. It provides a penalty for every step taken, which encourages the agent to move efficiently. If the game is over or the biped falls off the left side of the terrain, it receives a significant penalty. On the other hand, if it reaches the right end of the terrain without falling, it gets a large reward. The exponential transformation helps smooth out the rewards and prevent extreme values.
