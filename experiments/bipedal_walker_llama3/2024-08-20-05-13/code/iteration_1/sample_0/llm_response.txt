Based on the provided analysis, I'll analyze each existing reward component and then write a new reward function code proposal.

**Analysis**

1. **Movement**: The values are highly consistent, indicating that this component is well-defined and doesn't need significant changes.
2. **Fall**: All values are 0.0, suggesting that the "fall" component might not be contributing meaningfully to the policy's decisions. This could be due to the fact that the agent has learned to avoid falling or there's no penalty for falling in this environment.
3. **Fitness Score**: The values are highly negative, indicating that the agent is not improving its fitness score during training. This suggests that the reward function might need adjustments to encourage better performance.

**New Reward Function Proposal**

To improve the policy's performance and encourage better decisions, I'll modify the existing code by incorporating the insights from the analysis:

```python
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    hull_angle = state[0]
    vel_x = state[2]
    terminal = (pos[0] < 0) or self.game_over

    if terminal:
        reward = -1.0
        individual_reward = {"fall": -1.0}
    else:
        # Encourage forward movement with a moderate temperature
        movement_reward = np.exp((pos[0] + VIEWPORT_W / SCALE / 5) / TERRAIN_LENGTH)
        
        # Reduce the magnitude of the fall penalty to prevent over-punishing
        fall_penalty = max(-np.exp(hull_angle) * 0.1, 0)
        
        # Adjust the fitness score reward to encourage better performance
        fitness_reward = -np.abs(fitness_score - self.target_fitness_score)
        
        reward = movement_reward + fitness_reward - fall_penalty
        individual_reward = {"movement": movement_reward, "fall": fall_penalty, "fitness": fitness_reward}
    
    return reward, individual_reward
```

In this revised code:

* I've kept the "movement" component largely unchanged, as it seems well-defined.
* I've reduced the magnitude of the "fall" penalty to prevent over-punishing the agent for minor falls.
* I've introduced a new "fitness" reward component that encourages the agent to improve its fitness score. This is achieved by penalizing the agent for not reaching the target fitness score and rewarding it for surpassing it.

This revised reward function should encourage the agent to focus on improving its fitness score while still promoting forward movement and avoiding falls.
