Based on the provided policy feedback and analysis tips, here are my findings and suggestions for improving the reward function:

1. `movement`:
	* The values are mostly around 1670-1680, which suggests that this component is providing a decent signal to the agent.
	* Since we want to maximize positive rewards, I'll keep this component as is.
2. `fall`:
	* All values are 0.0, indicating that the agent is not falling or getting stuck.
	* This component seems redundant and doesn't provide any useful information to the agent.
	* Suggest discarding this component.

3. `fitness_score`:
	* The values are mostly negative, suggesting that the agent is not maximizing fitness scores during training.
	* Since we want to maximize fitness scores as a ground truth evaluator, I'll re-scale this component to provide more meaningful information to the agent.
4. `episode_length`:
	* All values are 1600.0, indicating that the episode length is constant and doesn't provide any useful information to the agent.
	* Suggest discarding this component.

New Reward Function Proposal:

```
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    hull_angle = state[0]
    vel_x = state[2]
    terminal = (pos[0] < 0) or self.game_over
    
    if terminal:
        reward = -1.0
        individual_reward = {"fitness": -100.0}  # high penalty for not maximizing fitness score
    else:
        # Encourage forward movement
        movement_reward = np.exp((pos[0] + VIEWPORT_W / SCALE / 5) / TERRAIN_LENGTH)
        # Re-scale fitness score to provide meaningful information to the agent
        fitness_score_reward = (1 - np.abs(fitness_score)) * 50.0
        reward = movement_reward + fitness_score_reward
        individual_reward = {"movement": movement_reward, "fitness": fitness_score_reward}
    
    return reward, individual_reward
```

In this new proposal:

* I've kept the `movement` component as is.
* I've discarded the `fall` and `episode_length` components.
* I've re-scaled the `fitness_score` to provide a more meaningful signal to the agent. The agent will now receive a higher reward for maximizing fitness scores during training.
* I've added an individual reward component for `fitness`, which penalizes the agent for not maximizing fitness scores.

This new reward function should better guide the agent towards solving the task, as it encourages forward movement and maximizes fitness scores while minimizing negative rewards.
