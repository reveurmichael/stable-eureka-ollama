Based on the provided policy feedback and analysis tips, here's an improved reward function proposal:

**New Reward Function Code Proposal:**
```python
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    hull_angle = state[0]
    vel_x = state[2]
    terminal = (pos[0] < 0) or self.game_over

    if terminal:
        reward = -1.0
        individual_reward = {"fall": -1.0}
    else:
        # Encourage forward movement and reduce penalty for falling
        movement_reward = np.exp((pos[0] + VIEWPORT_W / SCALE / 5) / TERRAIN_LENGTH)
        fall_penalty = max(-np.exp(hull_angle), 0) * 0.2  # reduced penalty
        reward = movement_reward - fall_penalty
        individual_reward = {"movement": movement_reward, "fall": fall_penalty}

    # Scale the fitness score to a meaningful range (e.g., [0, 1])
    fitness_score = self.calculate_fitness_score()
    scaled_fitness = np.tanh(fitness_score)  # use hyperbolic tangent for scaling

    reward += scaled_fitness
    individual_reward["fitness_score"] = scaled_fitness

    return reward, individual_reward
```
**Changes and Rationale:**

1. **Fall penalty reduction:** The fall penalty is now reduced by a factor of 0.2 to encourage more exploration and reduce the effect of falling.
2. **Fitness score scaling:** The fitness score is scaled using the hyperbolic tangent function (`np.tanh`) to bring it into a meaningful range (e.g., [0, 1]). This allows the policy to focus on maximizing the fitness score while still considering other reward components.

**Key Takeaways:**

* The `fall` component's values are nearly identical and should be re-written or discarded.
* The `fitness_score` component is the ground truth evaluator and should be scaled to a meaningful range.
* The overall reward function should encourage forward movement, reduce the penalty for falling, and scale the fitness score.

**Next Steps:**

Train the policy using this new reward function and evaluate its performance.
