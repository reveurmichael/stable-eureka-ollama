Based on the analysis of the policy feedback, I will provide a new reward function that addresses the issues and improves the performance.

From the feedback, we can see that:

1. The "fall" component has values very close to zero, indicating that it's not having much impact on the policy.
2. The "fitness_score" component is highly negative, which means it's dominating the overall reward signal. However, since it's supposed to be maximized, we need to scale it appropriately.
3. The "movement" component has a wide range of values, but its magnitude is relatively small compared to the "fitness_score".
4. The episode lengths are always 1600.0, which suggests that the policy is not exploring much.

Considering these points, I will modify the reward function as follows:

```
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    hull_angle = state[0]
    vel_x = state[2]
    terminal = (pos[0] < 0) or self.game_over
    
    if terminal:
        reward = -100.0
        individual_reward = {"fall": -1.0, "fitness_score": -100.0}
    else:
        # Encourage forward movement and adjust the scale
        movement_reward = np.tanh((pos[0] + VIEWPORT_W / SCALE / 5) / TERRAIN_LENGTH)
        
        # Scale down the fitness score to make it comparable with other components
        fitness_score_reward = np.exp(-1 * (state[-1])) * 10.0
        
        reward = movement_reward + fitness_score_reward - max(-np.exp(hull_angle), 0)
        individual_reward = {"movement": movement_reward, "fall": max(-np.exp(hull_angle), 0), "fitness_score": fitness_score_reward}
    
    return reward, individual_reward
```

In this new reward function, I've made the following changes:

* Removed the "fall" component's scaling and replaced it with a simple penalty based on the hull angle.
* Scaled down the "fitness_score" to make it comparable with other components. This should help the policy focus more on movement and exploration.
* Used the hyperbolic tangent function (tanh) to adjust the scale of the "movement" component. This should provide a more nuanced reward signal.

These changes should encourage the policy to explore more, maintain forward momentum, and maximize the fitness score. The new reward function should help improve the performance of the policy in the next training iteration.
