Based on the analysis of the policy feedback, I propose an improved reward function to better solve the task.

1. The "movement" component's values are mostly around 1670-1680, which suggests that this component is already well-tuned and doesn't need significant changes.
2. The "fall" component's values are all zeros, indicating that the current policy is not falling or getting stuck. This component can be discarded.
3. The "fitness_score" component has negative values, suggesting that it should be re-written to encourage higher fitness scores.
4. The "episode_length" component is constant at 1600.0, which suggests that this component is not relevant to the policy's performance and can be discarded.

Considering these observations, I propose a new reward function code:

```
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    hull_angle = state[0]
    vel_x = state[2]
    terminal = (pos[0] < 0) or self.game_over
    
    if terminal:
        reward = -1.0
        individual_reward = {"fitness_score": -1.0}
    else:
        # Encourage forward movement
        movement_reward = np.exp((pos[0] + VIEWPORT_W / SCALE / 5) / TERRAIN_LENGTH)
        # Increase fitness score
        fitness_bonus = (self.fitness_score + 25) / 50
        reward = movement_reward + fitness_bonus
        individual_reward = {"movement": movement_reward, "fitness_score": fitness_bonus}
    
    return reward, individual_reward
```

This new reward function encourages forward movement and increasing fitness scores. The "fall" component is discarded since the policy is not falling or getting stuck. The "episode_length" component is also discarded as it's not relevant to the policy's performance.

The next training iteration will take the best model weights, which should help improve the policy's performance with this new reward function.
