Based on the provided policy feedback and analysis tips, I'll review each existing reward component and propose a new reward function.

**Analysis**

1. **Movement**: The values are similar, with a mean of around 1673. This suggests that the movement reward is not doing much to encourage exploration or exploitation.
2. **Fall**: All values are 0, indicating that the fall penalty is not being triggered during training.
3. **Fitness score**: The values are mostly negative, which means the fitness score is not improving during training.

**Proposed New Reward Function**

The goal is to maximize the fitness score while encouraging movement and minimizing falling or getting stuck. Here's a new reward function proposal:

```python
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    hull_angle = state[0]
    vel_x = state[2]
    terminal = (pos[0] < 0) or self.game_over

    if terminal:
        reward = -1.0
        individual_reward = {"fall": -1.0}
    else:
        # Encourage forward movement and higher velocity
        movement_reward = np.exp((pos[0] + VIEWPORT_W / SCALE / 5) / TERRAIN_LENGTH)
        vel_x_reward = np.tanh(vel_x)  # Saturate velocity to encourage faster movement

        # Punish falling or getting stuck, but scale down the penalty
        fall_penalty = max(-np.exp(hull_angle) * 0.1, 0)

        reward = movement_reward + vel_x_reward - fall_penalty
        individual_reward = {"movement": movement_reward, "vel_x": vel_x_reward, "fall": fall_penalty}

    return reward, individual_reward
```

**Changes**

1. I've introduced a new reward component for velocity (`vel_x`) to encourage faster movement.
2. I've scaled down the fall penalty to make it less dominant in the overall reward calculation.
3. I've used `np.tanh` to saturate the velocity reward, so the agent doesn't get overly punished for small velocity increases.

This new reward function should better balance exploration and exploitation, while still encouraging movement and minimizing falling or getting stuck.
