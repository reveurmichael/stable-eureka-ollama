Based on the feedback analysis, here are my observations and suggestions for improving the reward function:

1. **Movement Reward**: The movement reward component has a mean value around 1673, indicating that this component is driving the policy's behavior. This suggests that the movement reward should be kept and potentially scaled down to prevent over-estimation of rewards.
2. **Fall Penalty**: The fall penalty component has a mean value of 0, indicating that the policy is not learning to avoid falling. This suggests that the fall penalty should be increased in magnitude or modified to provide more meaningful signals to the policy.
3. **Fitness Score**: The fitness score component has a negative mean value (-35.73), indicating that the policy is not optimizing the true objective function. This suggests that the fitness score should be incorporated as a primary reward component, rather than just a secondary metric.

Based on these observations, I propose the following improved reward function:

```
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    hull_angle = state[0]
    vel_x = state[2]
    terminal = (pos[0] < 0) or self.game_over
    
    if terminal:
        reward = -1.0
        individual_reward = {"fall": -1.0}
    else:
        # Encourage forward movement and optimize fitness score
        movement_reward = np.exp((pos[0] + VIEWPORT_W / SCALE / 5) / TERRAIN_LENGTH)
        fitness_penalty = -(fitness_score - self.fitness_score_threshold)
        reward = movement_reward + fitness_penalty
        individual_reward = {"movement": movement_reward, "fitness": fitness_penalty}
        
    return reward, individual_reward
```

In this proposal:

* I kept the movement reward component, but reduced its magnitude to prevent over-estimation.
* I increased the fall penalty magnitude to provide more meaningful signals to the policy.
* I incorporated the fitness score as a primary reward component, using it as a penalty term that encourages optimization of the true objective function.

Note that this proposal modifies the stable-eureka generated code and incorporates the feedback from the previous training.
