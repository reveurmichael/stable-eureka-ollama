Based on the provided feedback, I'll analyze each existing reward component and propose an improved reward function.

**Analysis**

1. **Movement**: The values are relatively stable, with a maximum value around 1679.7. This suggests that the movement reward component is well-scaled.
2. **Fall**: All values are zero, indicating that the policy has learned to avoid falling or getting stuck.
3. **Fitness Score**: The values are negative and quite large, ranging from -25.5 to -53.3. This suggests that the fitness score is not improving during training, which may be due to an overly punitive reward function.

**Proposed Improved Reward Function**

To address the issues with the fitness score and encourage more exploration, I propose a modified reward function:

```
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    hull_angle = state[0]
    vel_x = state[2]
    terminal = (pos[0] < 0) or self.game_over
    
    if terminal:
        reward = -1.0
        individual_reward = {"fall": -1.0}
    else:
        # Encourage forward movement and exploration
        movement_reward = np.exp((pos[0] + VIEWPORT_W / SCALE / 5) / TERRAIN_LENGTH)
        # Punish falling or getting stuck, but with a smaller penalty than before
        fall_penalty = max(-np.exp(hull_angle), 0) * 0.2
        # Introduce a bonus for maintaining a high velocity (exploration incentive)
        vel_bonus = np.tanh(vel_x / MAX_VEL)
        
        reward = movement_reward + vel_bonus - fall_penalty
        individual_reward = {"movement": movement_reward, "fall": fall_penalty, "velocity": vel_bonus}
    
    return reward, individual_reward
```

**Changes**

* Reduced the scale of the fall penalty to encourage more exploration.
* Introduced a velocity bonus to incentivize maintaining high velocities (exploration).
* Renamed the `individual_reward` dictionary keys to make it clearer which component each value corresponds to.

This proposed reward function aims to strike a balance between encouraging forward movement, exploring new areas, and avoiding falling or getting stuck. By introducing a velocity bonus, we hope to encourage the policy to maintain high velocities and explore new areas more effectively.
