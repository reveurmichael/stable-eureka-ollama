Based on the provided analysis feedback and the existing reward function, I propose an improved reward function to better solve the task. Here's my analysis and suggestion:

1. **Movement**: The movement component values are mostly identical (around 1673-1680), which might indicate that it's not providing a strong enough incentive for the policy to improve. Considering options a and b from the feedback, I suggest scaling down the movement reward to create more variance and encourage the policy to explore different actions.
2. **Fall**: The fall component values are consistently 0.0, indicating that the current implementation is not effective in penalizing falling or getting stuck. This might be due to the `max` function, which always returns 0 when the hull angle is positive. I propose re-writing this component to better capture the penalty for falling.
3. **Fitness score**: The fitness score values are mostly negative, indicating that the current policy is not maximizing the score during training. Since we want to maximize the fitness score, I suggest scaling up the movement reward and adjusting the fall penalty to encourage more exploration and improvement.

Here's my proposed improved reward function code:
```python
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    hull_angle = state[0]
    vel_x = state[2]
    terminal = (pos[0] < 0) or self.game_over

    if terminal:
        reward = -1.0
        individual_reward = {"fall": -1.0}
    else:
        # Encourage forward movement
        movement_reward = np.exp((pos[0] + VIEWPORT_W / SCALE / 5) / TERRAIN_LENGTH) * 2.0  # scaled up to encourage exploration
        # Punish falling or getting stuck
        fall_penalty = max(-np.sin(hull_angle), 0)  # re-write the fall penalty using sin() for a more nuanced penalty
        reward = movement_reward - fall_penalty
        individual_reward = {"movement": movement_reward, "fall": fall_penalty}

    return reward, individual_reward
```
The key changes are:

* Scaled up the movement reward to encourage exploration and improvement.
* Re-written the fall penalty using `max(-np.sin(hull_angle), 0)` to create a more nuanced penalty for falling.
* Kept the same logic for handling terminal states.

This improved reward function should better guide the policy towards maximizing the fitness score and minimizing the negative rewards.
