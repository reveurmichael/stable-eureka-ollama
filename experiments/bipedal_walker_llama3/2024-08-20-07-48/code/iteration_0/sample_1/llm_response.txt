```python
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    hull_angle = state[0]
    x_velocity = state[2]
    
    if pos[0] >= (TERRAIN_LENGTH - TERRAIN_GRASS) * TERRAIN_STEP:
        return 10.0, {'end_reached': 10.0}
    elif not self.game_over and abs(hull_angle) < ANGLE_THRESHOLD:
        return -0.1, {'stable_walk': -0.1}
    else:
        if x_velocity > 0:
            return -0.5, {'moving_forward': -0.5}
        else:
            return -10.0, {'fell_down': -10.0}

    ```
Explanation: This reward function encourages the agent to reach the end of the terrain by providing a high reward when it does so. It also discourages the agent from falling down or not moving forward by giving negative rewards in these situations. The magnitude of the reward is adjusted based on the angle of the hull and whether the agent is moving forward.
