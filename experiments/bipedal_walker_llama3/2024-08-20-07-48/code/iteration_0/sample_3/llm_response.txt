```python
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    distance_to_goal = TERRAIN_LENGTH - pos[0]
    reward = np.exp(-distance_to_goal / self.distance_coefficient) if not self.game_over else -1.0
    
    individual_reward = {'forward_reward': reward, 'stable_reward': 0.0}
    
    return reward, individual_reward
```

This reward function encourages the agent to move forward towards the goal while avoiding falling down or getting stuck. The distance to the goal is used as a base for the reward, and the `distance_coefficient` parameter allows you to adjust the importance of reaching the goal.
