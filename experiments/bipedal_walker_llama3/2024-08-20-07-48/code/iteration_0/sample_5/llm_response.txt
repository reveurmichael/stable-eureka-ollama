    total_reward = distance_reward - falling_punishment + movement_encouragement

Explanation: This reward function encourages the agent to move forward and reach the goal while avoiding falling down. The `distance_to_goal` reward decreases as the agent approaches the end of the terrain, providing a motivation for moving forward. The `falling_punishment` reward increases when the agent is falling (i.e., its vertical velocity is positive), discouraging this behavior. Finally, the `movement_encouragement` reward increases with the agent's horizontal speed, encouraging it to move as fast as possible while avoiding obstacles.
