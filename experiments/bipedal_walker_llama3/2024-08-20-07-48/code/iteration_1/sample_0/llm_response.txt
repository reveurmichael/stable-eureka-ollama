Based on the analysis of the policy feedback, I propose the following improved reward function:

```
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    distance_to_goal = TERRAIN_LENGTH - pos[0]
    
    if self.game_over or pos[0] < 0:
        return -100.0, {"terminal": True}
    elif pos[0] > (TERRAIN_LENGTH - TERRAIN_GRASS) * TERRAIN_STEP:
        return 100.0, {"success": True}
    
    reward = distance_to_goal / TERRAIN_LENGTH
    individual_reward = {"distance_reward": max(0, min(reward, 1))}  # Clip the distance reward to [0, 1]
    
    if state[-1]:
        individual_reward["fall"] = -20.0
    elif state[3] > 1.5:
        individual_reward["struggle"] = -10.0
    
    return max(0, sum(individual_reward.values())), {"success": individual_reward.get("success", False), "terminal": individual_reward.get("terminal", False)}
```

Key changes:

1. The `distance_reward` is clipped to the range [0, 1] to prevent large rewards that may not be desirable.
2. The overall reward is now the sum of all individual reward components, with a maximum value of 100. This allows the agent to balance multiple objectives and prioritize them correctly.

These changes aim to improve the policy's performance by:

* Encouraging the agent to move towards the goal (distance_reward) while preventing it from getting stuck in local optima.
* Discouraging falls and struggles, which can lead to negative outcomes.

The new reward function is designed to promote exploration and learning, as well as optimize the agent's behavior for achieving the desired outcome.
