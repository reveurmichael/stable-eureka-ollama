Based on the provided policy feedback and tips for analyzing feedback, I'll analyze each existing reward component first, then write a new reward function code proposal.

**Analysis**

1. **distance_reward**: The values seem to be around the same magnitude (~1560-1567). This suggests that the distance to the goal is being rewarded similarly throughout training. However, since we want to maximize positive reward components during training, I'll keep this component as is.
2. **fall**: All values are -32000.0, which indicates that falling has been consistently penalized throughout training. Since we want to minimize negative reward components, this component seems fine.
3. **fitness_score**: The values are all negative and decreasing, which suggests that the fitness score is not improving during training. This could be due to an overly simplified or incorrect reward function.
4. **reward**: This is just a sum of individual rewards (distance_reward, fall). Since it's based on the same components as distance_reward, we can ignore this one.

**New Reward Function Code Proposal**

To improve the fitness score and encourage the agent to reach the goal while avoiding falling, I'll propose the following new reward function:

```python
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    distance_to_goal = TERRAIN_LENGTH - pos[0]
    
    if self.game_over or pos[0] < 0:
        return -100.0, {"terminal": True}
    elif pos[0] > (TERRAIN_LENGTH - TERRAIN_GRASS) * TERRAIN_STEP:
        return 100.0, {"success": True}
    
    # Reward distance to goal
    distance_reward = min(distance_to_goal / TERRAIN_LENGTH, 1.0)
    
    # Penalty for falling
    fall_penalty = -20.0 if state[-1] else 0.0
    
    # Additional penalty for struggling (if applicable)
    struggle_penalty = -10.0 if state[3] > 1.5 else 0.0
    
    return distance_reward + fall_penalty + struggle_penalty, {}
```

In this new reward function, I've:

* Simplified the distance to goal component by using a minimum value of 1.0 (to avoid over-penalizing small distances)
* Added a fall penalty that's more aggressive than before (-20.0 instead of -100.0 for falling)
* Introduced an additional struggle penalty if the agent is struggling (state[3] > 1.5)

These changes aim to improve the fitness score by rewarding progress towards the goal and penalizing negative behaviors like falling or struggling.
