Based on the provided feedback, I'll analyze each existing reward component and then propose a new reward function code.

**Analysis**

1. **distance_reward**: The values are relatively high, with a maximum value of 1567.764812058209. This suggests that the agent is learning to move towards the goal. However, the mean value is around 1562.2293901083585, which indicates that there might be some room for improvement. Considering the scale and temperature parameter options (a-c), I will leave this component as it is.
2. **fall**: The values are all -32000.0, which suggests that the agent is not learning to avoid falling at all. This reward component seems irrelevant or too harsh. I recommend discarding this component (option c) since minimizing its value does not seem to be a priority.

**Proposed New Reward Function Code**

Considering the fitness score and the desire to maximize positive rewards, I will focus on improving the **distance_reward** component. Since the agent is already moving towards the goal, I'll add a term that encourages it to stay within a safe zone (e.g., the grassy area) and penalize it for straying into the danger zone.

Here's the proposed new reward function code:
```python
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    distance_to_goal = TERRAIN_LENGTH - pos[0]
    
    if self.game_over or pos[0] < 0:
        return -100.0, {"terminal": True}
    elif pos[0] > (TERRAIN_LENGTH - TERRAIN_GRASS) * TERRAIN_STEP:
        return 100.0, {"success": True}
    
    # Encourage movement towards the goal
    distance_reward = distance_to_goal / TERRAIN_LENGTH
    
    # Penalize straying into danger zone
    if state[-1]:  # assume this is the "danger" state
        distance_reward -= 5.0
    
    # Reward staying within safe zone (grassy area)
    if pos[0] > (TERRAIN_LENGTH - TERRAIN_GRASS) * TERRAIN_STEP:
        distance_reward += 2.0
    
    return distance_reward, {"distance_reward": distance_reward}
```
This new reward function encourages the agent to move towards the goal while penalizing it for straying into the danger zone and rewarding it for staying within the safe zone. The fitness score should improve with this new reward function.

Please note that I've removed the **fall** component as suggested, and only kept the **distance_reward** component to focus on improving movement and staying within the safe zone.
