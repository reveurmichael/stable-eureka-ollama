Based on the provided feedback, I'll analyze each existing reward component and propose an improved reward function.

1. `distance_reward`: The values are quite close to each other, but there's a slight increase over time. Considering this is the primary objective of the task (reaching the goal), it seems reasonable.
2. `fall`: All values are -32000.0, which suggests that this component is not contributing meaningfully to the overall reward. Given its negative magnitude and lack of variation, I recommend discarding this component or re-writing it to be more relevant.
3. `fitness_score`: The values are all negative, but there's some variation. Since the goal is to maximize the fitness score, I'll keep an eye on how this component affects the overall reward.

Considering these insights, I propose the following improved reward function:

```
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    distance_to_goal = TERRAIN_LENGTH - pos[0]
    
    if self.game_over or pos[0] < 0:
        return -100.0, {"terminal": True}
    elif pos[0] > (TERRAIN_LENGTH - TERRAIN_GRASS) * TERRAIN_STEP:
        return 100.0, {"success": True}
    
    reward = distance_to_goal / TERRAIN_LENGTH
    individual_reward = {"distance_reward": reward}
    
    if state[-1]:
        individual_reward["fitness_penalty"] = -20.0
    
    # Re-weight the fitness score to emphasize its importance
    individual_reward["fitness_score"] = max(0, self.fitness_score) * 10.0
    
    return reward, individual_reward
```

Key changes:

* Removed `fall` as it's not contributing meaningfully.
* Introduced a `fitness_penalty` component when the agent falls off the terrain.
* Re-weighted the fitness score to emphasize its importance and encourage higher scores.

This revised reward function should better align with the task objectives and provide more meaningful feedback during training.
