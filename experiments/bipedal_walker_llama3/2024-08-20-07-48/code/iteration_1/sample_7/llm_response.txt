Based on the analysis of the policy feedback, I'll provide suggestions for each existing reward component and propose a new reward function code.

1. **distance_reward**: The values are quite consistent, which suggests that this component is doing its job well. Since it's already scaled to be between 0 and 1, there's no need to change its scale or temperature parameter.
2. **fall**: All values are -32000.0, which means this component is not contributing much to the overall reward function. I would suggest discarding this component as it's not providing any useful information.

3. **fitness_score**: The mean and minimum values are quite low (-49.63421839378986 and -80.3463791934773, respectively). Since we want to maximize the fitness score, it seems that the current reward function is not encouraging good behavior. I would suggest re-writing this component or changing its scale.

4. **reward**: The values are mostly consistent with the distance_reward, which is a good sign. However, since the fitness_score is not improving during training, I would suggest considering changes to the reward function.

5. **episode_length**: All values are 1600.0, which means this component is not contributing much to the overall reward function either. It seems redundant and can be discarded.

Considering these suggestions, here's a proposed new reward function code:

```python
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    distance_to_goal = TERRAIN_LENGTH - pos[0]
    
    if self.game_over or pos[0] < 0:
        return -100.0, {"terminal": True}
    elif pos[0] > (TERRAIN_LENGTH - TERRAIN_GRASS) * TERRAIN_STEP:
        return 100.0, {"success": True}
    
    reward = distance_to_goal / TERRAIN_LENGTH
    individual_reward = {"distance_reward": reward}
    
    if state[-1]:
        # Re-weight the fall penalty to be less severe (e.g., -10 instead of -20)
        individual_reward["fall"] = -10.0
    
    return reward, individual_reward
```

This proposal modifies the original code by:

* Discarding the "struggle" component and the "fitness_score" component
* Re-weighting the "fall" penalty to be less severe

The goal is to create a more balanced reward function that encourages good behavior while avoiding extreme penalties. This new code should provide a better starting point for the next training iteration.

Note: I've kept the "distance_reward" component as it seems to be working well, and the episode_length component was not contributing much anyway. If you're concerned about the magnitude of the reward values, you can consider re-scaling them or introducing a temperature parameter to adjust their importance.
