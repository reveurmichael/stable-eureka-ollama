Based on the provided policy feedback, I'll analyze each existing reward component and propose a new reward function.

**Distance Reward**: The values are quite similar, which might be due to the fact that `distance_to_goal` is calculated as a simple fraction of `TERRAIN_LENGTH`. This could lead to a plateau in training. Suggestion: re-write the component using a more nuanced distance metric or add some curvature to the reward function.

**Fall Reward**: The values are all -32000.0, which means this reward component is not contributing much to the policy's behavior. This might be due to the fact that the episode length is always 1600.0, so the agent never really falls. Suggestion: discard or modify this component, as it's not providing useful feedback.

**Fitness Score**: The values are negative and decreasing over time, which means the policy is not improving its fitness score during training. This could be due to an incorrect reward function or a poorly designed environment. Suggestion: re-write the reward function to better align with the fitness score, or modify the environment to provide more challenging tasks.

**Episode Length**: The values are all 1600.0, which means the episodes are not terminating early enough. This might be due to a lack of termination conditions in the environment. Suggestion: add more termination conditions to the environment to encourage earlier episode termination.

Based on these analyses, I propose a new reward function:
```python
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    distance_to_goal = (TERRAIN_LENGTH - pos[0]) ** 2 / TERRAIN_LENGTH ** 2

    if self.game_over or pos[0] < 0:
        return -100.0, {"terminal": True}
    elif pos[0] > (TERRAIN_LENGTH - TERRAIN_GRASS) * TERRAIN_STEP:
        return 100.0, {"success": True}

    reward = distance_to_goal
    individual_reward = {"distance_reward": reward}

    if state[-1]:
        individual_reward["fall"] = -10.0

    # Introduce a "struggle" component to encourage the agent to avoid struggling
    struggle_reward = 2.0 * (state[3] > 1.5) - 1.0
    individual_reward["struggle"] = struggle_reward

    return reward, individual_reward
```
Changes:

* Re-wrote the distance reward using a more nuanced metric that encourages the agent to move closer to the goal.
* Discarded the "fall" component and replaced it with a more subtle penalty for struggling (based on the state).
* Introduced a new "struggle" component to encourage the agent to avoid struggling.

This new reward function should provide better guidance for the policy during training.
