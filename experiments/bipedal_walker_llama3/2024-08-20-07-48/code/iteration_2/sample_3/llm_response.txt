Based on the provided feedback, I'll analyze each reward component and propose an improved reward function.

**distance_reward**: The values are relatively consistent, indicating that this component is working well. No changes are necessary.

**fall**: All values are -32000.0, suggesting that this component should be re-written or discarded. Since it's a negative reward, its magnitude is significant, but the constant value makes it uninformative during training.

**fitness_score**: The values are all negative, indicating that the agent is not improving in terms of fitness score. To maximize the fitness score, we need to encourage positive rewards.

**reward**: This component is simply the sum of individual reward components. Since **distance_reward** and **fitness_score** are relatively well-behaved, we can keep this component as is.

**episode_length**: All values are 1600.0, indicating that the episode length is consistent. No changes are necessary for this component.

Based on these analyses, I propose a new reward function:
```python
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    distance_to_goal = TERRAIN_LENGTH - pos[0]
    
    if self.game_over or pos[0] < 0:
        return -100.0, {"terminal": True}
    elif pos[0] > (TERRAIN_LENGTH - TERRAIN_GRASS) * TERRAIN_STEP:
        return 100.0, {"success": True}
    
    reward = distance_to_goal / TERRAIN_LENGTH
    individual_reward = {"distance_reward": reward}
    
    if state[-1]:
        # Discard fall component and add a penalty for failure
        individual_reward["failure_penalty"] = -10.0
    elif state[3] > 1.5:
        # Encourage progress towards fitness score
        individual_reward["progress_bonus"] = 2.0
    
    return reward, individual_reward
```
Changes:

* Discarded the **fall** component and replaced it with a failure penalty.
* Added a progress bonus to encourage movement towards the goal.

This new reward function should better align the agent's behavior with the desired outcome, as measured by the fitness score.
