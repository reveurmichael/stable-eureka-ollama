Based on the analysis, I can see that there are several issues with the existing reward function:

1. The `fall` component always returns -32000.0, which means it's not providing any useful feedback during training.
2. The `fitness_score` component is also not helpful, as its values are all negative and seem to be decreasing over time.
3. The `distance_reward` component has a mean value of 1562.2293901083585, which suggests that the policy is generally moving in the correct direction, but there's still room for improvement.

Considering these issues, I propose the following improved reward function code:

```
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    distance_to_goal = TERRAIN_LENGTH - pos[0]
    
    if self.game_over or pos[0] < 0:
        return -100.0, {"terminal": True}
    elif pos[0] > (TERRAIN_LENGTH - TERRAIN_GRASS) * TERRAIN_STEP:
        return 100.0, {"success": True}
    
    reward = distance_to_goal / TERRAIN_LENGTH
    individual_reward = {"distance_reward": reward}
    
    if state[-1]:
        # Re-weight the fall penalty to be more significant
        individual_reward["fall"] = -10.0 * (reward > 0)
    elif state[3] > 1.5:
        # Introduce a struggle penalty that decreases as distance_to_goal increases
        struggle_penalty = max(0, (state[3] - 1.5) / TERRAIN_LENGTH) * -5.0
        individual_reward["struggle"] = struggle_penalty
    
    return reward + sum(individual_reward.values()), individual_reward
```

Changes made:

* Removed the `fitness_score` component altogether, as it's not providing any useful feedback.
* Re-weighted the `fall` penalty to be more significant when the policy is making progress (i.e., when `distance_to_goal > 0`).
* Introduced a `struggle` penalty that decreases as the distance to the goal increases. This should encourage the policy to make more efficient progress.

These changes aim to provide a more balanced and informative reward signal, which should help the policy improve during training.
