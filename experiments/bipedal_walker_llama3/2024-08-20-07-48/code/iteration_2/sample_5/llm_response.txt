Based on the provided policy feedback and analysis tips, I'll analyze each existing reward component and then write a new reward function code proposal.

**Analysis**

1. **distance_reward**: The values are quite consistent, with a maximum value of 1567.764812058209. This suggests that the distance to the goal is an important aspect of the task.
2. **fall**: All values are -32000.0, which indicates that this reward component is not contributing much to the overall performance. Since we want to maximize positive reward components and minimize negative ones, I recommend discarding or re-writing this component.
3. **fitness_score**: The mean value is -49.63421839378986, indicating that the fitness score is not improving during training. This suggests that the current reward function may not be aligned with the desired behavior.
4. **reward**: Similar to the distance_reward, the values are consistent, with a maximum value of 1567.7648127675056. However, since we already have a separate distance_reward component, this one can be discarded.

**New Reward Function Code Proposal**

Based on the analysis, I propose the following new reward function code:

```python
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    distance_to_goal = TERRAIN_LENGTH - pos[0]
    
    if self.game_over or pos[0] < 0:
        return -100.0, {"terminal": True}
    elif pos[0] > (TERRAIN_LENGTH - TERRAIN_GRASS) * TERRAIN_STEP:
        return 100.0, {"success": True}
    
    reward = distance_to_goal / TERRAIN_LENGTH
    individual_reward = {"distance_reward": reward}
    
    # Add a bonus for reaching the goal quickly
    if pos[0] > (TERRAIN_LENGTH - TERRAIN_GRASS) * TERRAIN_STEP:
        individual_reward["bonus"] = 10.0
    
    return reward, individual_reward
```

In this proposal, I've removed the fall and fitness_score components, as they were not contributing positively to the overall performance. The distance_to_goal component remains, with a bonus for reaching the goal quickly. This new reward function should encourage the agent to reach the goal efficiently while minimizing negative rewards.

Note that you may need to adjust the scales or temperatures of the individual reward components to achieve better convergence and performance.
