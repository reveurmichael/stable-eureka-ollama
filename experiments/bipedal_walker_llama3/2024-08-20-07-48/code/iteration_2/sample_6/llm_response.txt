Based on the provided feedback and analysis guidelines, I'll analyze each existing reward component and propose a new reward function.

**Analysis**

1. **distance_reward**: The values are relatively consistent, but not extremely high. This suggests that the distance to the goal is being used as a decent heuristic for evaluating progress.
2. **fall**: All values are -32000.0, indicating that this component is always penalizing the agent. This might be too harsh, and we can consider re-scaling or rewriting it.
3. **fitness_score**: The values are generally negative, with no clear pattern. Since this is the ground truth evaluator, we should aim to maximize it.
4. **episode_length**: All values are 1600.0, indicating that episodes always end after 1600 steps.

**New Reward Function Proposal**

Based on the analysis, I propose a new reward function that aims to balance exploration and progress towards the goal while minimizing penalties:
```python
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    distance_to_goal = TERRAIN_LENGTH - pos[0]
    
    if self.game_over or pos[0] < 0:
        return -100.0, {"terminal": True}
    elif pos[0] > (TERRAIN_LENGTH - TERRAIN_GRASS) * TERRAIN_STEP:
        return 100.0, {"success": True}
    
    # Encourage progress towards the goal
    reward = distance_to_goal / TERRAIN_LENGTH
    
    # Minimize penalties for falling or struggling
    if state[-1]:
        penalty = -5.0
    elif state[3] > 1.5:
        penalty = -2.0
    
    # Combine rewards and penalties
    individual_reward = {"distance_reward": reward, "penalty": penalty}
    
    return reward + penalty, individual_reward
```
Changes:

* I kept the original distance-to-goal heuristic as a positive reward component.
* Introduced a penalty component that depends on the agent's state (falling or struggling).
* Combined the rewards and penalties to create a single overall reward.

This new reward function aims to balance exploration and progress towards the goal while minimizing penalties for undesirable states. The next training iteration can utilize this revised reward function, leveraging some of the relevant information from previous trainings.
