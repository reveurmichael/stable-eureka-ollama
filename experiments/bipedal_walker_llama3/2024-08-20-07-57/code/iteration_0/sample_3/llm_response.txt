This reward function aims to encourage the biped to move forward, maintain a stable posture, and avoid getting stuck. The components of the reward are:

- Distance reward: Incentivizes the agent to reach the end of the terrain, with the reward decreasing exponentially as it approaches the goal.
- Stability reward: Penalizes the agent for having an unstable hull angle, promoting more upright postures.
- Movement reward: Rewards the agent for moving forward, with a higher reward given to faster movements.
- Legs contact reward: Incentivizes the agent to have both legs in contact with the ground, ensuring it does not get stuck.

These components are combined and exponentially transformed to provide a smooth and continuous reward signal.
