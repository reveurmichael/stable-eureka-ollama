    reward = -1.0 if not done else 10.0
    individual_reward = {"velocity": -abs(vel_x), "falling": -10.0 if pos[0] < 0 else 0.0, "reached_end": 10.0 if pos[0] > (TERRAIN_LENGTH - TERRAIN_GRASS) * TERRAIN_STEP else 0.0}

This reward function aims to encourage the biped to move forward and avoid falling down. The main reward is a negative value for each step taken (-1.0), which discourages the agent from staying still. If the biped reaches the end of the terrain or falls off, it receives a positive reward (10.0). The "velocity" component encourages the agent to move at high speeds, and the "falling" component strongly penalizes falling off the terrain.
