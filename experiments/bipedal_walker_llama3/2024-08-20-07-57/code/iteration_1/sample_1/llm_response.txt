Based on the provided feedback, I'll analyze each existing reward component and then propose an improved reward function.

**Distance**: The values are mostly negative, which indicates that the policy is trying to move away from the goal. However, the maximum value is around -301,386, which suggests that there's still room for improvement. Since we want to maximize the fitness score, I'll keep this component as it is.

**Falling**: This component always returns 0, indicating that falling has not been penalized during training. Since we don't want agents to fall, I'll keep this component and adjust its value.

**Fitness Score**: The values are mostly negative, which suggests that the policy is still learning to improve the fitness score. We want to maximize the fitness score, so I'll keep this component as it is.

**Reward**: The values are all positive, indicating that the policy has been successful in most episodes. Since we want to maximize positive rewards and minimize negative ones, I'll keep this component as it is.

Based on these findings, here's a proposed improved reward function:

```
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    distance_to_goal = abs(pos[0] - TERRAIN_LENGTH)  # Reward closer to the goal
    penalty_for_falling = max(0, -pos[1])  # Punish for falling down
    
    fitness_score = self.fitness_function(state)  # Use a more accurate fitness function
    
    reward = np.exp(-distance_to_goal / TERRAIN_LENGTH) + fitness_score  # Combine distance and fitness score
    individual_reward = {'distance': -distance_to_goal, 'falling': penalty_for_falling, 'fitness_score': fitness_score}
    
    return reward, individual_reward

def fitness_function(self, state):
    # Implement a more accurate fitness function based on the state
    pass
```

In this proposal, I've introduced a new component called `fitness_score`, which is calculated using a more accurate fitness function. This will help the policy learn to improve the fitness score directly. I've also adjusted the `penalty_for_falling` component to only penalize falling when the agent is below a certain height (i.e., max(0, -pos[1])).

The overall reward structure remains similar, with a combination of distance-to-goal and fitness-score rewards. The new fitness function will be used to calculate the fitness score for each state.
