Analyzing the policy feedback:

1. The "distance" component has a large range of values (-310569 to -301386), which suggests that this component should be scaled or its temperature parameter adjusted.

2. The "falling" component always returns 0, indicating that the agent is not falling in the environment, so this component can be discarded.

3. The "fitness_score" component has a large range of values (-80 to -44), which suggests that it should be scaled or adjusted based on the problem's specific requirements.

4. The "reward" component always returns positive values (2206-2203), indicating that the agent is generally doing well in the environment.

5. The "episode_length" component is constant and always returns 1600, which does not provide any useful information for adjusting the reward function.

Based on these observations, I propose a new reward function code:

```
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    # Reward closer to the goal
    distance_to_goal = abs(pos[0] - TERRAIN_LENGTH)
    
    # Punish for falling down
    penalty_for_falling = 10 if pos[1] < 0 else 0
    
    # Scale the fitness score based on its maximum value
    max_fitness_score = np.max(self.individual_rewards['fitness_score'])
    scaled_fitness_score = self.individual_rewards['fitness_score'] / max_fitness_score

    reward = -distance_to_goal + penalty_for_falling * 0.1 + scaled_fitness_score
    
    individual_reward = {'distance': -distance_to_goal, 'falling': penalty_for_falling, 'fitness_score': scaled_fitness_score}
    
    return np.array([reward]), individual_reward
```

This new reward function takes into account the distance to the goal, penalizes for falling down, and scales the fitness score based on its maximum value. The agent is rewarded for getting closer to the goal, but at a slower rate as it approaches the goal, which encourages exploration and more efficient movement towards the goal. The penalty for falling down provides an incentive for the agent to avoid falling, while the scaled fitness score allows the agent to maximize its overall performance based on the problem's specific requirements.
