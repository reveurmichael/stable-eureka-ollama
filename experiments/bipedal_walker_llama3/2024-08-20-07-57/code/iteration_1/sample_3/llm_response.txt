Based on the provided feedback and analysis tips, I'll analyze each existing reward component:

1. `distance`: The values are mostly negative, with a maximum value of -301386.80247950554. This indicates that the agent is not doing well in terms of distance to the goal.
2. `falling`: All values are 0, indicating that the agent never fell during training.

Based on these observations, I will modify the reward function to:

* Encourage the agent to move closer to the goal by increasing the magnitude of the distance component.
* Remove the falling penalty since it's not being used in training (all values are 0).

New Reward Function Proposal:
```python
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    distance_to_goal = abs(pos[0] - TERRAIN_LENGTH)  # Reward closer to the goal
    reward = -(distance_to_goal / TERRAIN_LENGTH)  # Increase distance to goal reward
    
    individual_reward = {'fitness_score': fitness_score}  # Maximize fitness score
    
    return np.array([reward]), individual_reward, False, False, {}
```
In this new reward function, I've:

* Removed the falling penalty (since it's not being used in training).
* Increased the magnitude of the distance component by multiplying it with a negative value.
* Introduced the `fitness_score` as a separate reward component to maximize during training.

This modified reward function should encourage the agent to move closer to the goal and focus on maximizing its fitness score.
