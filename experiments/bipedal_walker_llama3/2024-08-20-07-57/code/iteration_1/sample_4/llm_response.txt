Analyzing the feedback:

1. The "distance" component's values are all negative and decreasing with a maximum value of -301386.80247950554, which suggests that the agent is not reaching the goal quickly enough. This could be due to the exponential decay in the reward function.
2. The "falling" component has only zeros, indicating that the agent didn't fall off the terrain during training. This component seems redundant and can be discarded.

Reward reflection:
We want to maximize the fitness score as it is the ground truth evaluator. Also, we should maximize positive reward components values during training and minimize negative reward components values.
Considering these insights, I will modify the existing reward function code proposal:

```
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    # Calculate distance from goal
    distance_to_goal = abs(pos[0] - TERRAIN_LENGTH)
    
    # Calculate penalty for falling (but this is redundant as it's always 0)
    #penalty_for_falling = 10 if pos[1] < 0 else 0
    
    # Define the reward components
    distance_reward = -distance_to_goal
    fitness_reward = self.fitness_score
    
    # The goal is to maximize the fitness score and minimize the distance from the goal
    reward = fitness_reward + (TERRAIN_LENGTH - distance_to_goal) * TERRAIN_STEP
    
    individual_reward = {'fitness_score': fitness_reward, 'distance': distance_reward}
    
    return np.array([reward]), individual_reward
```

This modified reward function prioritizes maximizing the fitness score and minimizing the distance from the goal.
