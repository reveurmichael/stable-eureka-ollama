Based on the provided feedback and policy reflection, I can analyze each component to determine if any improvements can be made.

**Distance**: The values for this component are mostly negative, which makes sense since the goal is to minimize the distance to the goal. However, the maximum value (-301386.80247950554) seems quite large compared to the mean and minimum values. This could indicate that the reward function is not effectively promoting exploration towards the goal.

**Falling**: The values for this component are all zeros, which suggests that the policy is not falling during training (good!). However, having a separate component for "falling" might not be necessary if the agent is not actually falling. This component could be discarded or re-written to encourage more exploration.

Considering these findings, I propose an updated reward function:

```
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    distance_to_goal = abs(pos[0] - TERRAIN_LENGTH)  # Reward closer to the goal
    penalty_for_falling = 10 if pos[1] < 0 else 0  # Punish for falling down

    reward = np.exp(-distance_to_goal / TERRAIN_STEP) + (penalty_for_falling * 0.5)  # Scale down the falling penalty
    individual_reward = {'distance': -distance_to_goal, 'falling': penalty_for_falling}

    return reward, individual_reward
```

In this updated function:

* I've replaced `TERRAIN_LENGTH` with `TERRAIN_STEP` to make the distance-to-goal calculation more meaningful.
* I've scaled down the falling penalty by a factor of 0.5 to reduce its impact on the overall reward.

By updating the reward function, we can encourage the agent to explore more effectively towards the goal while still penalizing it for falling.

The new reward code is:
