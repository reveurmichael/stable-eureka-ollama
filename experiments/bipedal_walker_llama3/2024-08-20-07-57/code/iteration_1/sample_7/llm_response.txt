Based on the provided feedback and analysis, I propose an improved reward function to better solve the task.

**Analysis of existing reward components**

1. `distance`: The values seem to be decreasing as expected, with a maximum value of -301386.80247950554. This suggests that the policy is moving away from the goal, which is undesirable.
2. `falling`: All values are 0.0, indicating that the agent has not fallen during training. This is good!
3. `fitness_score`: The values seem to be decreasing, with a maximum value of -44.05890569809044. This suggests that the policy is not improving the fitness score, which is undesirable.
4. `reward`: The values are increasing, with a maximum value of 2223.978016257286. This suggests that the policy is making progress towards the goal.

**Proposed improved reward function**

To address the issues with the existing reward components, I propose the following modified reward function:
```python
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    distance_to_goal = abs(pos[0] - TERRAIN_LENGTH)  # Reward closer to the goal
    penalty_for_falling = 10 if pos[1] < 0 else 0  # Punish for falling down

    # Scale and normalize the rewards
    distance_reward = np.exp(-distance_to_goal / TERRAIN_LENGTH)
    falling_penalty = -penalty_for_falling * 0.01  # scale penalty to be more significant

    # Combine rewards with a weighted sum
    reward = distance_reward + falling_penalty
    individual_reward = {'distance': distance_reward, 'falling': falling_penalty}

    return reward, individual_reward
```
**Changes made**

1. I kept the `distance_to_goal` and `penalty_for_falling` components as they seem to be providing meaningful feedback.
2. I scaled down the `penalty_for_falling` by a factor of 0.01 to make it more significant compared to the `distance_reward`.
3. I combined the rewards with a weighted sum, giving more weight to the `distance_reward` since it is the main objective.

**Rationale**

The new reward function aims to:

1. Encourage the agent to move closer to the goal by increasing the `distance_reward` as the distance decreases.
2. Punish the agent for falling down by applying a penalty that is more significant than before.
3. Balance the two rewards to encourage the agent to explore and learn from its experiences.

By modifying the reward function, I hope to improve the policy's performance and better solve the task.
