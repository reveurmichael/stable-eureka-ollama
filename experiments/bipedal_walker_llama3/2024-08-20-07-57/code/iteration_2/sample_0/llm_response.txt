Based on the provided feedback and analysis tips, I'll analyze each existing reward component:

1. **distance**: The values are negative and decreasing as the policy gets better. This suggests that the distance to the goal should be minimized. However, the magnitude of the values is significant (-30 million to -3 million), which may not provide enough guidance for the policy during training.

2. **falling**: The values are all zeros, indicating that falling has no impact on the reward function. Since we want to avoid falling, this component should be modified or re-written.

3. **fitness_score**: This is the ground truth evaluator and should be maximized. However, its magnitude is relatively small (-80 to -44), which may not provide enough guidance for the policy during training.

4. **reward**: The values are all positive and increasing as the policy gets better. This suggests that the reward function is currently focused on maximizing the fitness score.

Considering these points, I propose a new reward function:

```
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    distance_to_goal = abs(pos[0] - TERRAIN_LENGTH)
    penalty_for_falling = 10 if pos[1] < 0 else 0
    bonus_for_fitness = self.fitness_score
    
    # Scale the rewards to provide more guidance during training
    reward = -distance_to_goal + penalty_for_falling + bonus_for_fitness / 100.0
    
    individual_reward = {'distance': -distance_to_goal, 'falling': penalty_for_falling, 'fitness_score': bonus_for_fitness}
    
    return reward, individual_reward
```

In this proposal:

* The distance to the goal is still minimized.
* Falling incurs a penalty (10 in this case).
* The fitness score is now positively rewarded, but scaled down by 100.0 to provide more guidance during training.
* The magnitude of the rewards has been increased to provide more guidance for the policy.

This new reward function should guide the policy towards maximizing the fitness score while minimizing the distance to the goal and avoiding falling.
