Based on the provided feedback and analysis guidelines, I'll analyze each existing reward component:

1. **distance**: The values are quite high in absolute value (-310569.5 to -301386.8), which suggests that this component should be scaled down significantly.

2. **falling**: All values are 0.0, indicating that the policy is not falling during training. This component doesn't seem to affect the policy's behavior much and can be discarded or re-written to make it more meaningful.

3. **fitness_score**: The values range from -80.1187106930577 to -44.05890569809044, which indicates that this component should be scaled down significantly.

4. **reward**: The values are relatively high (2206.2119849324226 to 2223.978016257286), suggesting that the policy is generally rewarded for its actions.

To improve the reward function, I'll keep the main ideas from the original code and make some adjustments:

**New Reward Function:**
```python
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    distance_to_goal = abs(pos[0] - TERRAIN_LENGTH)  # Reward closer to the goal
    falling_penalty = int(pos[1] < 0)  # Punish for falling down (binary penalty)
    
    # Scale down large components and add a bonus term for high fitness scores
    reward = -(distance_to_goal / TERRAIN_LENGTH) + falling_penalty - (fitness_score / 100.0)
    
    individual_reward = {'distance': -distance_to_goal, 'falling': falling_penalty}
    
    return reward, individual_reward
```
Here's what I changed:

* Scaled down the `distance` and `fitness_score` components to make them less dominant in the overall reward.
* Replaced the exponential function with a simple scaling (division by `TERRAIN_LENGTH`) for the `distance` component.
* Introduced a binary penalty (`falling_penalty`) for falling, as the original values were all 0.0.
* Added a bonus term `- (fitness_score / 100.0)` to encourage high fitness scores.

This new reward function should better balance the exploration-exploitation trade-off and encourage the policy to move closer to the goal while avoiding falls and maximizing fitness scores.
