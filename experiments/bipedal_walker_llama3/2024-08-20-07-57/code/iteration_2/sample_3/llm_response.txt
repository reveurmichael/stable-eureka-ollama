A reinforcement learning problem! Let's dive into the analysis and propose an improved reward function.

**Analysis**

1. **Distance**: The values are quite close, indicating that the distance component is not strong enough to guide the policy towards the goal. We'll scale this component later.
2. **Falling**: The values are all zeros, suggesting that the agent never fell during training. This component might not be necessary or effective in guiding the policy.
3. **Fitness score**: The maximum and mean values are relatively low, indicating that the fitness score is not increasing significantly during training. We'll use this as a reference point to improve the reward function.

**Rewritten Reward Function Proposal**

To maximize the fitness score and encourage the agent to reach the goal while avoiding falling, we'll combine the distance component with a more significant penalty for falling:

```python
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    distance_to_goal = abs(pos[0] - TERRAIN_LENGTH)
    penalty_for_falling = 100 if pos[1] < 0 else 0

    reward = -(distance_to_goal / TERRAIN_LENGTH) + penalty_for_falling
    individual_reward = {'distance': -distance_to_goal, 'falling': penalty_for_falling}

    return reward, individual_reward
```

**Key Changes**

1. We've scaled the distance component by subtracting it from 1 (i.e., `-(distance_to_goal / TERRAIN_LENGTH)`) to encourage the agent to reach the goal.
2. The penalty for falling is now more significant (100), which should help the agent avoid falling and stay on the terrain.
3. We've kept the fitness score component as a reference point, but not used it directly in the reward function.

The new reward function combines the distance component with a penalty for falling to encourage the agent to reach the goal while avoiding obstacles. This should improve the policy's performance and increase the fitness score during training.
