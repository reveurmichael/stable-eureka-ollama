A great challenge!

Let's analyze each existing reward component:

1. **distance**: The values are spread out, but the maximum value is relatively low (-301386.8). This suggests that the policy is not strongly motivated to move closer to the goal.
2. **falling**: All values are 0, indicating that the policy never falls during training. This might be because the penalty for falling is too small or the policy has learned to avoid falling altogether.

Given these observations, I'll propose an updated reward function that incorporates the insights from the feedback:

**New Reward Function:**

```python
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    distance_to_goal = abs(pos[0] - TERRAIN_LENGTH)  # Reward closer to the goal
    penalty_for_falling = np.exp(-pos[1]) * 10  # Punish for falling down (stronger penalty)

    # Scale rewards and penalties based on the terrain length
    scaled_distance = distance_to_goal / TERRAIN_LENGTH
    scaled_penalty = np.exp(-penalty_for_falling) * 10

    reward = -scaled_distance + scaled_penalty  # Maximize fitness score, minimize negative rewards

    individual_reward = {'distance': -scaled_distance, 'falling': scaled_penalty}

    return reward, individual_reward
```

Changes made:

* Increased the penalty for falling (exponential decay) to encourage the policy to avoid falling.
* Scaled the distance and penalty values based on the terrain length to ensure that both components have similar magnitudes.
* Rewarded the policy for moving closer to the goal (-distance) while minimizing penalties for falling.

This new reward function should provide a stronger motivation for the policy to move towards the goal while avoiding falls.
