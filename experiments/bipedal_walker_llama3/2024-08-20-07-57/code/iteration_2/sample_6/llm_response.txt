Based on the analysis of the policy feedback, I'll provide an improved reward function.

**Distance Reward Component:**
The distance component's values are mostly negative and decreasing as expected. However, the maximum value (-301386.80247950554) is quite large compared to the mean (-307026.020807457). This suggests that there may be some outliers or extreme cases where the policy performs poorly. I'll re-scale this component to have a more reasonable magnitude.

**Falling Reward Component:**
The falling component's values are all zeros, indicating that the policy never falls in any episode during training. This is likely due to the penalty for falling being too low (10). I'll increase the penalty for falling and make it proportional to the height of the fall.

Here's the improved reward function code proposal:

```
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    distance_to_goal = abs(pos[0] - TERRAIN_LENGTH)  # Reward closer to the goal
    penalty_for_falling = max(10 * (pos[1] + TERRAIN_STEP), 0)  # Punish for falling down
    
    reward = np.exp(-distance_to_goal / TERRAIN_LENGTH) - penalty_for_falling
    individual_reward = {'distance': -distance_to_goal, 'falling': penalty_for_falling}
    
    return reward, individual_reward
```

In this proposal:

1. I've re-scaled the distance component using an exponential function to have a more reasonable magnitude.
2. I've increased the penalty for falling by multiplying it with the height of the fall (pos[1] + TERRAIN_STEP). This should encourage the policy to stay on the terrain and avoid falling.

This improved reward function should help the policy learn to navigate the terrain more effectively and achieve higher fitness scores.
