Based on the provided feedback, I'll analyze each existing reward component and propose an improved reward function.

1. **Distance to goal**: The values of this component are negative, which means we want to minimize distance to the goal. This seems correct since we're trying to reach the end of the terrain. However, the range of values is large (-310569.5 to -301386.8), which may affect the learning process.
2. **Falling**: The values of this component are all zeros, indicating that the policy never fell during training. This might not be a reliable indicator of performance since we can't always expect the agent to fall.

Considering these observations and the tips for analyzing feedback:

* Change the scale or temperature parameter for the distance component to make it more meaningful.
* Discard the falling component since it's not providing useful information.
* Maximize positive reward components values during training (distance) and minimize negative ones (fitness score).
* Consider using a combination of rewards, such as distance-to-goal and fitness-score-based rewards.

Here's my proposal for an improved reward function:
```python
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    # Distance to goal: scale the values between 0 and 1
    distance_to_goal = abs(pos[0] - TERRAIN_LENGTH) / (TERRAIN_LENGTH * 2)
    # Fitness score: use a combination of rewards to maximize fitness score
    fitness_reward = np.exp(-fitness_score / (TERRAIN_LENGTH * 2))
    reward = distance_to_goal + fitness_reward

    individual_reward = {'distance': -distance_to_goal, 'fitness': fitness_reward}

    return reward, individual_reward
```
In this proposal:

* The distance-to-goal component is scaled between 0 and 1 to make the values more meaningful.
* The fitness-score-based reward combines a negative exponential term with the distance-to-goal component. This encourages the policy to maximize both the distance to the goal and the fitness score.
* I've discarded the falling component since it's not providing useful information.

This improved reward function aims to balance the exploration-exploitation trade-off by combining rewards that encourage reaching the end of the terrain (distance) with those that promote maximizing the fitness score.
