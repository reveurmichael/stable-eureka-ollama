```python
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    reward = 0.0
    individual_rewards = {}

    # Reward for reaching the end of the terrain
    if pos[0] > (TERRAIN_LENGTH - TERRAIN_GRASS) * TERRAIN_STEP:
        reward += REACHING_END_REWARD
        individual_rewards['reaching_end'] = REACHING_END_REWARD

    # Penalty for falling down or getting stuck
    if self.game_over or pos[0] < 0:
        reward -= FALLING_DOWN_PENALTY
        individual_rewards['falling_down'] = -FALLING_DOWN_PENALTY

    # Encourage forward movement
    if action[0] > 0:  # Only consider the first element of the action vector
        reward += FORWARD_MOTION_REWARD
        individual_rewards['forward_motion'] = FORWARD_MOTION_REWARD

    return reward, individual_rewards
```

Explanation:

The reward function aims to encourage the agent to reach the end of the terrain while avoiding falling down or getting stuck. It rewards the agent for making progress towards the end and penalizes it for falling down or getting stuck. The forward motion is also encouraged by giving a small positive reward when the agent moves forward.
