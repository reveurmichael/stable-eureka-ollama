```python
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    hull_angle = state[0]
    vel_x = state[2]
    reached_end = pos[0] > (TERRAIN_LENGTH - TERRAIN_GRASS) * TERRAIN_STEP
    reward = 10.0 if reached_end else -1.0
    
    individual_reward = {'reached_end': reward}
    
    return reward, individual_reward
```

Explanation: The goal is to reach the end of the terrain while avoiding falling down or getting stuck. We provide a positive reward when the biped reaches the end and a negative reward otherwise.
