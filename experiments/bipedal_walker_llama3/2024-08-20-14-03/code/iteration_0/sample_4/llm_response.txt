```python
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    hull_angle_diff = abs(pos[0] - self.prev_pos[0]) if self.prev_pos else 0
    vel_x = state[2]
    reward = 1.0 + vel_x * 0.5 + np.exp(hull_angle_diff / 10) * 0.3

    individual_reward = {"forward_reward": 1.0 + vel_x, "angle_reward": np.exp(hull_angle_diff / 10), "velocity_reward": 0.5}

    self.prev_pos = pos
    return reward, individual_reward
```

The reward function aims to encourage the biped to move forward and maintain a good balance. The total reward is calculated as the sum of three components: "forward_reward", "angle_reward", and "velocity_reward". The "forward_reward" increases with the biped's velocity in the x-direction, while the "angle_reward" is designed to penalize large changes in the hull's angle. This encourages the agent to maintain a stable posture while moving forward. The "velocity_reward" provides a bonus for high velocities, which favors the agent reaching the end of the terrain quickly.
