Based on the provided feedback, I'll analyze each component and provide suggestions for improvement.

1. **velocity**: The values seem to be roughly equally distributed around a mean of ~7.09. This could indicate that velocity is not a strong contributor to the overall reward. Considering the magnitude of the velocity values (~10-9), it might be worth scaling this component down or re-writing it.
2. **distance_to_goal**: The values are highly variable, with a maximum value more than 20 times larger than the minimum. This suggests that distance to goal is an important contributor to the overall reward. However, since we want to maximize positive rewards and minimize negative ones, it might be beneficial to scale this component down or re-write it.
3. **fitness_score**: The values are highly negative, with a maximum value only slightly larger than the minimum. This could indicate that fitness score is not contributing positively to the overall reward. Considering its magnitude (~100-103), it might be worth scaling this component down or re-writing it.

Considering these insights, I propose a new reward function:

```
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    hull_angle = (state[0] + math.pi) % (2 * math.pi) - math.pi
    vel_x = state[3]
    dist_to_goal = (pos[0] - TERRAIN_LENGTH) / TERRAIN_STEP

    # Scale velocity and distance to goal components
    scaled_velocity = 0.1 * np.abs(vel_x)
    scaled_distance_to_goal = -0.5 * np.exp(-dist_to_goal / 10000)

    # Use the fitness score as a target for the reward
    target_fitness = -60  # A reasonable target value

    # Calculate the reward based on the individual components
    reward = (target_fitness - state[4]) ** 2 + scaled_velocity + scaled_distance_to_goal

    individual_reward = {'velocity': scaled_velocity,
                          'distance_to_goal': scaled_distance_to_goal}

    return reward, individual_reward
```

This new reward function:

* Scales down the velocity and distance to goal components to reduce their impact on the overall reward.
* Uses the fitness score as a target value to guide the agent's behavior.
* Combines the individual components into a single reward value that encourages the agent to achieve the target fitness score while minimizing the negative effects of velocity and distance to goal.

This new reward function should help the agent learn to balance its actions to achieve a good trade-off between fitness, velocity, and distance to goal.
