Based on the provided policy feedback and analysis tips, I'll analyze each existing reward component and then write a new reward function proposal.

**Velocity Component**
The velocity values range from 1.27 to 10.39, which is a significant magnitude difference. Scaling the velocity component could help balance its impact on the overall reward. A possible adjustment is to divide the velocity by a scaling factor (e.g., 5) to bring its magnitude closer to that of other components.

**Distance_to_goal Component**
The distance_to_goal values range from 11,766 to 223,188, which is an enormous magnitude difference. Scaling this component could help balance its impact on the overall reward. A possible adjustment is to divide the distance_to_goal by a scaling factor (e.g., 10) to bring its magnitude closer to that of other components.

**Fitness_score Component**
The fitness_score values are negative and range from -103.64 to -26.97, which indicates that the agent should strive to minimize this component. The mean value is around -69.5, indicating that the current reward function may not be incentivizing the agent to improve its performance.

**Episode_length Component**
The episode_length values range from 85.5 to 1600.0, which is a moderate magnitude difference. However, since the goal is to maximize the fitness_score, this component might not have a significant impact on the overall reward.

Considering these observations and analysis tips, I propose the following new reward function:

```
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    hull_angle = (state[0] + math.pi) % (2 * math.pi) - math.pi
    vel_x = state[3]
    dist_to_goal = (pos[0] - TERRAIN_LENGTH) / TERRAIN_STEP
    
    reward = 0.1 * np.exp(1) * (np.cos(hull_angle)) + 0.05 * np.exp(0.5) * np.abs(vel_x) / 5 - 0.05 * np.exp(0.5) * dist_to_goal / 10 - 0.01 * fitness_score
    individual_reward = {'hull_alignment': 0.1 * np.exp(1) * (np.cos(hull_angle)),
                          'velocity': 0.05 * np.exp(0.5) * np.abs(vel_x) / 5,
                          'distance_to_goal': -0.05 * np.exp(0.5) * dist_to_goal / 10,
                          'fitness_score': -0.01 * fitness_score}
    
    return reward, individual_reward
```

In this proposal:

* I've introduced a new term to the reward function that directly rewards the agent for improving its fitness score.
* I've scaled down the magnitude of the velocity and distance_to_goal components by dividing them by 5 and 10, respectively, to balance their impact on the overall reward.
* The hull_alignment component remains largely unchanged, as it seems to be a crucial aspect of the task.

This revised reward function should incentivize the agent to improve its performance, align its hull with the goal, maintain a reasonable velocity, and minimize its distance to the goal while maximizing its fitness score.
