After analyzing the policy feedback, I've identified a few issues with the existing reward function:

1. The `fitness_score` component has negative values, which suggests that the agent should be penalized for not achieving high fitness scores. However, the magnitude of these penalties is quite large, making it difficult to learn.
2. The `distance_to_goal` component has very different scales than the other components, which could affect learning.
3. There's no direct reward for maximizing positive velocity.

To address these issues, I propose the following revised reward function:

```python
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    vel_x = state[3]
    dist_to_goal = (pos[0] - TERRAIN_LENGTH) / TERRAIN_STEP
    
    # Reward for maximizing fitness score
    fitness_score_reward = 1.0 * np.exp(-np.abs(fitness_score))  # scale down large penalties
    
    # Reward for positive velocity
    vel_x_reward = 2.0 * np.abs(vel_x)
    
    # Reward for decreasing distance to goal
    dist_to_goal_reward = -1.5 * np.exp(-dist_to_goal / 100.0)  # scale down large distances
    
    reward = fitness_score_reward + vel_x_reward + dist_to_goal_reward
    
    individual_reward = {'fitness_score': fitness_score_reward,
                         'velocity': vel_x_reward,
                         'distance_to_goal': dist_to_goal_reward}
    
    return reward, individual_reward
```

This revised reward function:

1. Scales down the `fitness_score` penalties to make learning easier.
2. Introduces a separate reward for positive velocity, which should encourage the agent to maintain high speeds.
3. Modifies the `distance_to_goal` component to use an exponential decay function, which will punish the agent more heavily for large distances.

This revised reward function should better guide the agent towards achieving high fitness scores and completing tasks efficiently.
