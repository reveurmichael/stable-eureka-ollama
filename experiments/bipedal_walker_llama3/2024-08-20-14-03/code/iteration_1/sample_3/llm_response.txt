Let's analyze each existing reward component:

1. `velocity`: The values are quite spread out (1.3 to 10.4), but there doesn't seem to be a clear pattern or correlation with the desired outcome (maximizing fitness score). Since we want to maximize positive reward components, I'll consider re-scaling this component.
2. `distance_to_goal`: The values are much larger than the others (min: 11,666; max: 223,188), which is expected since it measures the distance to the goal. However, there doesn't seem to be a clear correlation with the fitness score. Since we want to minimize this component, I'll consider re-scaling it.
3. `fitness_score`: The values are mostly negative (min: -103; max: -27), which is expected since we're trying to maximize the fitness score. However, there doesn't seem to be a clear correlation with the other reward components.

Based on this analysis, I'll propose an improved reward function:

```
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    hull_angle = (state[0] + math.pi) % (2 * math.pi) - math.pi
    vel_x = state[3]
    dist_to_goal = (pos[0] - TERRAIN_LENGTH) / TERRAIN_STEP
    
    reward = 10.0 * np.exp(1) * (np.cos(hull_angle)) + 5.0 * np.abs(vel_x) - 0.001 * np.exp(2) * dist_to_goal
    individual_reward = {'hull_alignment': 10.0 * np.exp(1) * (np.cos(hull_angle)),
                           'velocity': 5.0 * np.abs(vel_x),
                           'distance_to_goal': -0.001 * np.exp(2) * dist_to_goal}
    
    return reward, individual_reward
```

Changes:

* Scaled `velocity` component by a factor of 5 to make it more relevant.
* Re-scaled `distance_to_goal` component by a factor of 1000 to make it less dominant and more comparable to the other components.
* Kept the `hull_alignment` component mostly unchanged, as it seems to be correlated with the fitness score.

This new reward function should better encourage the agent to align its hull, maintain positive velocity, and minimize distance to the goal.
