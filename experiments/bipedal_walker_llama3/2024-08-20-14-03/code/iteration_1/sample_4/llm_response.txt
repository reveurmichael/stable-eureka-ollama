Based on the provided feedback data, I'll analyze each existing reward component and then propose an improved reward function.

**Velocity:** The values are relatively high, with a maximum value of 10.38. This suggests that the agent is moving in the desired direction, which is good! However, there's some variability in the values, so we might want to consider re-scaling or modifying this component to encourage more consistent movement.

**Distance_to_goal:** The values are extremely high, with a maximum value of 223187.695. This suggests that the agent is not getting close to the goal quickly enough. We should consider re-scaling this component to make it less dominant in the reward calculation.

**Fitness_score:** The values are mostly negative, with some small positive values. This suggests that the agent is not maximizing the fitness score. We should aim to create a reward function that encourages improving the fitness score.

**Episode_length:** The values are relatively short, with most episodes being around 800 time steps. This suggests that the agent is completing episodes quickly and efficiently. We might want to consider incorporating this information into the reward function to encourage shorter episode lengths.

Considering these observations, I propose a new reward function:
```
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    hull_angle = (state[0] + math.pi) % (2 * math.pi) - math.pi
    vel_x = state[3]
    dist_to_goal = (pos[0] - TERRAIN_LENGTH) / TERRAIN_STEP
    
    # Reward velocity and hull alignment
    velocity_reward = 0.1 * np.abs(vel_x)
    
    # Punish distance to goal, but make it less dominant than before
    distance_punishment = -0.01 * dist_to_goal
    
    # Encourage improving fitness score
    fitness_reward = 0.05 * (max_fitness_score - state[4])
    
    # Discourage long episode lengths
    episode_punishment = -0.001 * len(state)
    
    reward = velocity_reward + distance_punishment + fitness_reward + episode_punishment
    
    individual_rewards = {'velocity': velocity_reward,
                           'distance_to_goal': distance_punishment,
                           'fitness': fitness_reward,
                           'episode_length': episode_punishment}
    
    return reward, individual_rewards
```
In this proposal, I've:

1. Reduced the importance of distance to goal by scaling it down.
2. Introduced a new component that rewards improving fitness score.
3. Discouraged long episode lengths by introducing an episode punishment term.
4. Re-scaled the velocity component to make it less dominant.

This new reward function should encourage the agent to improve its performance, move in the desired direction, and complete episodes efficiently.
