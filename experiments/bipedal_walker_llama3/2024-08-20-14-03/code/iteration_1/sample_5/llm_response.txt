Analyzing the existing reward function and feedback:

1. The `fitness_score` component has a wide range of values, but its mean value is negative. This suggests that the agent is not improving over time.
2. The `reward` component has a high mean value, indicating that the agent is making progress in most episodes. However, there are some low values, which might be caused by the agent not always reaching the goal.
3. The `episode_length` component indicates that the average episode length is around 800 steps, which suggests that the agent is taking some time to learn.

Based on these observations and the tips for analyzing policy feedback, I propose an improved reward function:

```
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    hull_angle = (state[0] + math.pi) % (2 * math.pi) - math.pi
    vel_x = state[3]
    dist_to_goal = (pos[0] - TERRAIN_LENGTH) / TERRAIN_STEP
    
    reward = 0.7 * np.exp(1) * (np.cos(hull_angle) + np.abs(vel_x)) - 0.5 * np.exp(0.5) * dist_to_goal
    individual_reward = {'hull_alignment': 0.7 * np.exp(1) * (np.cos(hull_angle)),
                          'velocity': 0.7 * np.exp(1) * np.abs(vel_x),
                          'distance_to_goal': -0.5 * np.exp(0.5) * dist_to_goal}
    
    # Encourage the agent to reach the goal by rewarding it for each step closer
    reward += 0.2 * (TERRAIN_LENGTH - dist_to_goal)
    
    return reward, individual_reward
```

Changes made:

1. Increased the weights of the `hull_alignment` and `velocity` components to emphasize their importance.
2. Reduced the weight of the `distance_to_goal` component to encourage the agent to reach the goal more quickly.
3. Added a new term that rewards the agent for each step closer it gets to the goal.

These changes should help the agent improve its performance by focusing on reaching the goal and aligning its hull while maintaining a good velocity.
