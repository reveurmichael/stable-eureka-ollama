Based on the provided feedback data and the existing reward function, I'll analyze each component and propose an improved reward function.

**Velocity (10.3878 to 1.2720)**: The magnitude of velocity values varies greatly, suggesting that this component should be re-scaled or normalized. 

**Distance_to_goal (11766 to 223188)**: This component has a very large range, indicating that it may be dominating the overall reward.

**Fitness_score (-100.994 to -26.974)**: The fitness score is the ground truth evaluator and should be maximized during training.

**Episode_length (85.5 to 1600.0)**: This component seems relatively minor in comparison to others, so I won't focus on it for now.

Given these observations, here's my proposal for an improved reward function:

```
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    hull_angle = (state[0] + math.pi) % (2 * math.pi) - math.pi
    vel_x = state[3]
    dist_to_goal = (pos[0] - TERRAIN_LENGTH) / TERRAIN_STEP
    
    # Scale velocity values
    scaled_vel_x = (vel_x - 1.2720) / (10.3878 - 1.2720)
    
    # Normalize distance to goal
    normalized_dist_to_goal = dist_to_goal / max_distance_to_goal
    
    reward = 0.3 * fitness_score + 0.2 * scaled_vel_x + 0.5 * normalized_dist_to_goal
    
    individual_reward = {'fitness': 0.3 * fitness_score,
                          'velocity': 0.2 * scaled_vel_x,
                          'distance_to_goal': 0.5 * normalized_dist_to_goal}
    
    return reward, individual_reward
```

In this proposal:

1. I re-scaled the velocity component to have values between 0 and 1.
2. I normalized the distance to goal by dividing it by its maximum value.
3. The fitness score is given a higher weight (0.3) since it's the ground truth evaluator.
4. The individual reward components are now more balanced.

This new reward function should better reflect the desired behavior and guide the agent towards maximizing the fitness score while minimizing negative reward components.
