Based on the provided feedback and analysis tips, I'll analyze each existing reward component and propose a new reward function.

1. `fitness_score`: The values are mostly negative, which means we want to maximize the fitness score during training. However, the scale of this component is relatively small compared to others. To give it more importance, let's scale it up.
2. `velocity`: The values range from 1.3 to 10.4, indicating that high velocity is desirable. We'll keep this component as is, but consider scaling it to emphasize its importance.
3. `distance_to_goal`: The values are relatively large (up to 223,187), indicating that moving closer to the goal is important. This component should be scaled down to give it a similar weight to the others.

New Reward Function Proposal:
```python
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    hull_angle = (state[0] + math.pi) % (2 * math.pi) - math.pi
    vel_x = state[3]
    dist_to_goal = (pos[0] - TERRAIN_LENGTH) / TERRAIN_STEP
    
    # Scale down distance_to_goal to give it a similar weight to others
    dist_to_goal_scaled = dist_to_goal / 10000.0
    
    reward = 10 * self.fitness_score + 5 * vel_x - 2 * dist_to_goal_scaled
    
    individual_reward = {'hull_alignment': 0.5 * np.exp(1) * (np.cos(hull_angle)),
                         'velocity': 5 * np.abs(vel_x),
                         'distance_to_goal': -2 * dist_to_goal_scaled}
    
    return reward, individual_reward
```
In this proposal, I've:

* Scaled up the `fitness_score` to give it more importance.
* Kept the `velocity` component as is, but consider scaling it down if necessary.
* Scaled down `distance_to_goal` to give it a similar weight to the others.

This new reward function should better encourage the agent to achieve high fitness scores, maintain high velocity, and move closer to the goal.
