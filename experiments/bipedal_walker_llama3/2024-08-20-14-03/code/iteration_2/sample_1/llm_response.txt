Based on the provided feedback, I'll analyze each existing reward component and propose an improved reward function.

**Velocity**: The magnitude of velocity values is relatively consistent, but there's a significant range (1.3 to 10.4). To address this, we can scale the velocity component by dividing it by its maximum value (10.387818298648272).

**Distance_to_goal**: The values are large and vary significantly. To normalize these values, we can divide them by their maximum value (223187.69593763346) or use a logarithmic transformation.

**Fitness_score**: We want to maximize the fitness score, so we should make it positive. Since the minimum value is -103.6408826379627 and the mean is around -69.5, let's scale the fitness score by dividing it by its maximum absolute value (-103.6408826379627).

**Reward**: This component seems to be a combination of velocity, distance_to_goal, and possibly other components. We can break it down further.

Here's the proposed improved reward function:
```python
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    hull_angle = (state[0] + math.pi) % (2 * math.pi) - math.pi
    vel_x = state[3]
    dist_to_goal = (pos[0] - TERRAIN_LENGTH) / TERRAIN_STEP
    
    velocity_reward = 0.5 * np.exp(1) * (np.abs(vel_x) / 10.387818298648272)
    distance_reward = -0.2 * np.exp(0.5) * dist_to_goal / 223187.69593763346
    fitness_reward = (fitness_score / abs(fitness_score.max())) + 1
    
    reward = velocity_reward + distance_reward + fitness_reward
    
    individual_rewards = {
        'hull_alignment': 0.5 * np.exp(1) * (np.cos(hull_angle)),
        'velocity': velocity_reward,
        'distance_to_goal': distance_reward,
        'fitness_score': fitness_reward
    }
    
    return reward, individual_rewards
```
This revised reward function aims to:

* Scale velocity and distance_to_goal components to more reasonable ranges.
* Make the fitness score positive and comparable in magnitude to other components.
* Combine these components into a single reward value.
