Analyzing the existing policy feedback:

1. Velocity component:
	* The values range from 1.27 to 10.39, which suggests that the velocity is not significantly contributing to the overall reward.
	* Since we want to maximize positive reward components values during training, consider scaling down or discarding this component.
2. Distance to goal component:
	* The values are large (up to 223,187), indicating that this component has a significant impact on the overall reward.
	* This component should be scaled down to avoid overpowering the other components and encourage exploration.
3. Fitness score component:
	* The values range from -103.64 to -26.97, indicating that this component is important for guiding the agent towards optimal behavior.
	* Since we want to maximize fitness scores, consider scaling up or re-scaling this component to prioritize its contribution.

New reward function proposal:

```python
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    hull_angle = (state[0] + math.pi) % (2 * math.pi) - math.pi
    vel_x = state[3]
    dist_to_goal = (pos[0] - TERRAIN_LENGTH) / TERRAIN_STEP
    
    # Scale down velocity component
    velocity_reward = 0.1 * np.abs(vel_x)
    
    # Scale up fitness score component
    fitness_score_reward = 0.5 * (1 + np.tanh(fitness_score))
    
    # Adjust distance to goal component to encourage exploration
    dist_to_goal_reward = -0.05 * np.exp(-dist_to_goal / 10000) * math.cos(hull_angle)
    
    reward = velocity_reward + fitness_score_reward + dist_to_goal_reward
    
    individual_rewards = {'hull_alignment': 0.5 * np.exp(1) * (np.cos(hull_angle)),
                          'velocity': velocity_reward,
                          'distance_to_goal': dist_to_goal_reward}
    
    return reward, individual_rewards
```

This new reward function maintains the original components and adjusts their scales to prioritize fitness scores and encourage exploration while minimizing the distance to goal. The velocity component is scaled down to avoid overpowering the other components.
