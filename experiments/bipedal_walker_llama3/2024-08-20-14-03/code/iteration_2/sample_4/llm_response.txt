Based on the provided feedback and analysis tips, I'll analyze each existing reward component and propose an improved reward function.

1. **Velocity**: The values are mostly positive, which means the policy is encouraged to maintain a certain velocity. However, there's no clear trend or correlation with the fitness score. This could be due to the lack of scaling or temperature parameters for this component.
2. **Distance_to_goal**: The values are highly variable and correlated with the fitness score (lower values mean better performance). This suggests that the distance to the goal is an important aspect of the task, but it's not well-balanced with other components.
3. **Fitness_score**: The values are negative and mostly decreasing, indicating that the policy should minimize this component to improve its overall performance. However, the fitness score seems to be the ground truth evaluator, so we'll focus on maximizing it.
4. **Reward**: This is a combination of velocity and distance_to_goal components, with some scaling factors. It's unclear how these individual components are weighted or what their relative importance is.

Based on these observations, I propose an improved reward function that focuses on maximizing the fitness score while encouraging reasonable velocities and minimizing distance to the goal:

```
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    hull_angle = (state[0] + math.pi) % (2 * math.pi) - math.pi
    vel_x = state[3]
    dist_to_goal = (pos[0] - TERRAIN_LENGTH) / TERRAIN_STEP
    
    # Maximize fitness score
    fitness_reward = 100 * np.exp(-fitness_score)
    
    # Encourage reasonable velocity
    velocity_reward = 10 * np.abs(vel_x)
    
    # Minimize distance to goal
    dist_reward = -0.1 * dist_to_goal
    
    # Combine rewards with weights
    reward = fitness_reward + 0.5 * velocity_reward - 0.8 * dist_reward
    
    individual_reward = {
        'fitness': fitness_reward,
        'velocity': velocity_reward,
        'distance_to_goal': dist_reward
    }
    
    return reward, individual_reward
```

This new reward function:

* Maximizes the fitness score (encourages better performance)
* Encourages reasonable velocities with a smaller weight than the fitness score
* Minimizes distance to the goal with an even smaller weight

The weights can be adjusted based on experimentation and analysis of the policy's performance.
