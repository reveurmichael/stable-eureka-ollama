Based on the provided feedback, I'll analyze each existing reward component and propose an improved reward function.

**Velocity (reward)**:
The velocity values are reasonable, but they don't seem to be strongly correlated with the fitness score. The mean value is around 7, which suggests that the agent is moving at a moderate pace. To make the velocity more impactful on the overall reward, I'll scale it up and consider its magnitude in relation to the distance to the goal.

**Distance to Goal (reward)**:
The distance values are very large, which might be causing the agent to focus too much on this component. Scaling down these values will help balance the importance of reaching the goal with moving towards it.

**Fitness Score (reward)**:
As the fitness score is the ground truth evaluator, we should prioritize maximizing its value. This means that the reward function should incentivize actions that lead to a higher fitness score.

**Episode Length (no direct impact on reward, but useful for analysis)**:
The episode length values are relatively high, which might indicate that the agent is not terminating episodes quickly enough. We can use this information to adjust the reward schedule or terminate episodes earlier when the agent has reached a certain threshold.

Proposed Improved Reward Function:

```python
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    hull_angle = (state[0] + math.pi) % (2 * math.pi) - math.pi
    vel_x = state[3]
    dist_to_goal = (pos[0] - TERRAIN_LENGTH) / TERRAIN_STEP

    # Scale down large distance values
    scaled_dist_to_goal = np.exp(-dist_to_goal / 10000)

    # Prioritize maximizing fitness score and velocity magnitude
    reward = 0.5 * np.exp(1) * (np.cos(hull_angle) + np.abs(vel_x)) - 0.2 * scaled_dist_to_goal

    individual_reward = {'hull_alignment': 0.5 * np.exp(1) * (np.cos(hull_angle)),
                          'velocity': 0.5 * np.exp(1) * np.abs(vel_x),
                          'distance_to_goal': -0.2 * scaled_dist_to_goal}

    return reward, individual_reward
```

Changes made:

* Scaled down large distance values to balance the importance of reaching the goal with moving towards it.
* Prioritized maximizing fitness score and velocity magnitude to encourage actions that lead to a higher fitness score.

This improved reward function should guide the agent towards better performance in the task.
