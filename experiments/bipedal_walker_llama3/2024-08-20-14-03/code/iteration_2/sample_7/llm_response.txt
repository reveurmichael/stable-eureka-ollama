To analyze the existing reward function and provide an improved version, I'll go through each component:

1. `velocity`: The values are quite large, with a maximum value of around 10.4. This could be due to the exponential scaling (`np.exp(1)`). Considering this is a velocity component, it might be better to scale it more moderately.
2. `distance_to_goal`: The mean value is extremely high (111175.5560351717), indicating that this component plays a significant role in determining the reward. Scaling it down would help balance its impact with other components.
3. `fitness_score`: This component seems to be the most important, as it's trying to maximize the fitness score. However, the values are quite large and negative (around -69). It might be better to scale this component more moderately.

Considering these observations, I propose an improved reward function:

```
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    hull_angle = (state[0] + math.pi) % (2 * math.pi) - math.pi
    vel_x = state[3]
    dist_to_goal = (pos[0] - TERRAIN_LENGTH) / TERRAIN_STEP
    
    reward = 0.5 * np.cos(hull_angle) + 0.1 * np.abs(vel_x) - 0.001 * dist_to_goal
    individual_reward = {'hull_alignment': 0.5 * np.cos(hull_angle),
                          'velocity': 0.1 * np.abs(vel_x),
                          'distance_to_goal': -0.001 * dist_to_goal}
    
    return reward, individual_reward
```

I made the following changes:

* Reduced the velocity component's scaling from `np.exp(1)` to `0.1`, which should better capture the importance of velocity.
* Scaled down the `distance_to_goal` component by a factor of 1000 (`0.001`) to balance its impact with other components.
* Removed the exponential scaling for the hull alignment component, as it's already well-captured by the cosine function.

The goal is to maximize the fitness score while keeping the episode length relatively short. This new reward function should encourage the agent to balance these factors and achieve a better overall performance.
