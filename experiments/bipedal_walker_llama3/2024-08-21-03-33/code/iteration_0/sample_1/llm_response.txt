The goal of the reward function is to encourage the biped to move forward as fast as possible while avoiding falling down and getting stuck in certain positions. The reward function consists of three main components: hull angle, velocity x, and leg on ground. 

*   Hull angle: This component rewards the agent for maintaining a stable position by encouraging it to keep its hull at or near 0 degrees (horizontal). The exponential transformation helps to make this reward more prominent as the biped gets closer to its goal.
*   Velocity x: This component penalizes the agent for moving slowly. The negative absolute value of the velocity x is used, which means that faster movements will be rewarded and slower ones will be penalized.
*   Leg on ground: This component rewards the agent for keeping at least one leg grounded, indicating that it's not stuck in a certain position.
