```python
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    hull_angle = state[0]
    x_velocity = state[2]

    distance_to_goal = abs(pos[0] - TERRAIN_LENGTH)
    fall_penalty = 1.0 if pos[1] < 0 else 0.0
    reward = -np.exp(-distance_to_goal) - fall_penalty + np.exp(x_velocity)

    individual_reward = {'distance_to_goal': -np.exp(-distance_to_goal), 'fall_penalty': fall_penalty, 'x_velocity': np.exp(x_velocity)}

    return reward, individual_reward
```
This reward function encourages the biped to reach the end of the terrain as quickly and efficiently as possible. It does this by subtracting a penalty for distance from the goal (negative exponential) and adding a bonus for x-velocity (positive exponential). Additionally, it penalizes falling down (1 if fallen, 0 otherwise). This reward function is designed to promote movement forward while minimizing falls and obstacles.
