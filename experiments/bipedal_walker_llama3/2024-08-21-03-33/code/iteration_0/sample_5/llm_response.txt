```python
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    reward = -1.0 + (pos[0] / TERRAIN_LENGTH) ** 2  # penalty for not moving forward
    individual_reward = {'forward_progress': reward}
    
    if pos[0] > (TERRAIN_LENGTH - TERRAIN_GRASS) * TERRAIN_STEP:
        reward += 10.0  # bonus for reaching the end
        individual_reward['end_reached'] = 10.0
    
    if self.game_over or pos[0] < 0:
        terminated = True
        reward -= 10.0  # penalty for falling down
        individual_reward['fell_down'] = -10.0
    
    return reward, individual_reward
```

This reward function encourages the agent to move forward towards the right end of the terrain while avoiding falling down or getting stuck. The reward is composed of two components: a negative term that penalizes the agent for not moving forward and a positive term that rewards the agent for reaching the end.
