Explanation:
The goal is to encourage the biped to move forward as fast and smoothly as possible while avoiding falling down. The reward function includes three components: a penalty for leaning too much (hull angle), a penalty for moving too slowly (velocity x), and a big penalty if the biped falls down (velocity y). If the biped is stuck or not moving, it receives a small penalty. The individual_reward dictionary provides more detailed information about each component of the reward.
