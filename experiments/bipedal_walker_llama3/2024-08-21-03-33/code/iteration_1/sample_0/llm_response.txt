Based on the provided policy feedback, I'll analyze each existing reward component and provide a new reward function code proposal.

1. **moving_forward**: The values are quite diverse (7.5 to 1570.0), indicating that this component should not be discarded. However, its scale is quite large compared to others. To address this, we can re-scale it by dividing all values by the maximum value (1570.0).

2. **penalty**: The values are relatively consistent (around 9.94), suggesting that this component's scale might be suitable. Since fitness score is the ground truth evaluator and should be maximized, we want to minimize penalty. We can re-scale it by multiplying all values by -1.

3. **fitness_score**: This is the ground truth evaluator, which should be maximized. However, its values are negative and quite diverse (-100.94 to -53.74). To address this, we'll re-scale it by dividing all values by the maximum value (-100.94).

4. **reward**: This component seems to be a combination of other components (moving_forward and penalty). Since it's already a decent reward function, we won't modify it significantly.

5. **episode_length**: The values are identical (1600.0), indicating that this component is not providing any useful information. We can discard it.

Considering the above analysis, I propose the following new reward function:

```python
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    distance_to_goal = abs(pos[0] - TERRAIN_LENGTH)
    
    # Re-scaled moving_forward
    moving_forward_reward = np.exp(-(distance_to_goal ** 2) / 1000) * (1 if pos[0] < 0 or pos[0] > TERRAIN_GRASS * TERRAIN_STEP else 0)
    
    # Re-scaled penalty
    penalty = -0.01 * (state[6] + state[13])
    
    # Maximize fitness score
    fitness_score_reward = np.exp(-(state[-1] / 100.94))
    
    individual_reward = {"progress": moving_forward_reward, "penalty": penalty, "fitness_score": fitness_score_reward}
    
    return sum(individual_reward.values()), individual_reward
```

In this new reward function:

* **moving_forward** is re-scaled to be between 0 and 1.
* **penalty** is re-scaled by multiplying all values by -1 to minimize it.
* **fitness_score** is re-scaled to maximize its value.
* The individual rewards are combined into a single reward value using the sum of their values.

This new reward function should provide more informative feedback for training the agent.
