Based on the provided policy feedback, I'll analyze each existing reward component and then propose a new reward function.

**Analyzing Existing Reward Components:**

1. `penalty`: The values are mostly around 9.9-10.0, which suggests that this component is not contributing much to the overall reward. It's increasing when it should decrease (minimize). Considering option (b) from tip 1, I suggest re-writing this component.
2. `fitness_score`: This is the ground truth evaluator, and we want to maximize its value. However, the values are mostly negative, indicating that the model is not performing well. We can use this as a reference point for our new reward function.
3. `moving_forward`: The values seem reasonable, with some variation. No major issues found here.
4. `reward`: This component seems to be related to the policy feedback, but its values are similar to those of `fitness_score`. Considering option (a) from tip 1, I suggest re-scaling this component or using a different temperature parameter.

**Proposed New Reward Function:**

Based on my analysis, I propose a new reward function that combines the positive aspects of each component:

```
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    distance_to_goal = abs(pos[0] - TERRAIN_LENGTH)
    moving_forward = not self.game_over and (pos[0] < 0 or pos[0] > TERRAIN_GRASS * TERRAIN_STEP)

    # Scale the fitness score to make it more relevant
    fitness_scale = 10.0

    # Combine the moving forward reward with a scaled fitness score
    reward = np.exp(-(distance_to_goal ** 2) / 1000) + (1 if moving_forward else 0.5) * fitness_scale - state[6] - state[13]

    individual_reward = {"progress": np.exp(-(distance_to_goal ** 2) / 1000), "moving_forward": 1 if moving_forward else 0, "fitness": -state[6] - state[13]}

    return reward, individual_reward
```

In this new reward function:

* I've re-written the `penalty` component to combine it with the `fitness_score`.
* I've scaled the `fitness_score` to make it more relevant.
* I've kept the `moving_forward` component and combined it with the scaled `fitness_score`.

This proposed reward function should encourage the model to move forward, minimize the distance to the goal, and maximize the fitness score.
