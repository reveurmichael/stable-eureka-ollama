I'll analyze each existing reward component to identify potential issues and propose improvements.

1. `moving_forward`: The values are generally increasing, but there's a large gap between the minimum (7.5) and maximum (1570.0). This suggests that the scale might be too wide. I'll re-scale it by dividing all values by the maximum value.
2. `penalty`: The values are mostly around 9.9-10.06, which is very close to a single value. This could indicate that the penalty component is not providing enough variation in rewards. I'll try to modify or discard this component.
3. `fitness_score`: This is the ground truth evaluator, and its values are negative and varying. We want to maximize it.
4. `reward`: The values are similar to the `penalty` component, suggesting that they might be redundant. I'll analyze the individual components of `reward`.
5. `episode_length`: All values are identical (1600.0), indicating that this component is not providing any useful information.

Now, let's focus on the `reward` component:

* `progress` seems to be related to the agent's movement towards the goal.
* `moving_forward` provides a small reward when the agent moves forward.
* The penalty term (`state[6] + state[13]`) is subtractive and might not be contributing positively to the overall reward.

To improve the reward function, I'll propose the following changes:

1. Combine `progress` and `moving_forward` into a single component that encourages movement towards the goal.
2. Re-scale the penalty term to provide more variation in rewards.
3. Modify the reward function to prioritize maximizing the fitness score.

Here's the revised reward function code proposal:
```python
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    distance_to_goal = abs(pos[0] - TERRAIN_LENGTH)
    movement_reward = np.exp(-(distance_to_goal ** 2) / 1000) * (1 if pos[0] > TERRAIN_GRASS * TERRAIN_STEP else 0.5)
    
    penalty = -0.001 * (state[6] + state[13])  # Re-scaled and modified
    
    fitness_reward = np.exp(fitness_score)  # Maximize the fitness score
    
    reward = movement_reward + penalty + fitness_reward
    
    individual_reward = {"progress": movement_reward, "penalty": penalty, "fitness": fitness_reward}
    
    return reward, individual_reward
```
This revised reward function should encourage the agent to move towards the goal while minimizing penalties and maximizing the fitness score.
