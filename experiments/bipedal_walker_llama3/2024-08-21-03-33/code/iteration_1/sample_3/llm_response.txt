Based on the provided feedback, I'll analyze each existing reward component and then propose a new reward function.

**Penalty Component Analysis**: The penalty component values are mostly around 9.9-10.0, which suggests that this component should be re-scaled or possibly rewritten to have more significant variations in its values. This is because the goal of reinforcement learning is to maximize the overall reward, and if one component dominates the others, it may lead to suboptimal solutions.

**Moving Forward Component Analysis**: The moving forward component has a reasonable range of values (7.5-1570.0), indicating that this component captures meaningful information about the agent's progress. However, since we want to maximize positive reward components and minimize negative ones, we should re-scale or normalize these values to have a more significant impact on the overall reward.

**Fitness Score Component Analysis**: The fitness score is the ground truth evaluator, but its values are mostly negative (around -86.0). This suggests that our current reward function may not be aligned with the optimal solution, as we want to maximize this value. We should re-write or modify this component to encourage better solutions.

**Reward Function Proposal**: Based on the analysis above, I propose a new reward function:

```
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    distance_to_goal = abs(pos[0] - TERRAIN_LENGTH)
    
    # Re-scale moving forward rewards
    moving_forward_rewards = np.tanh((pos[0] - TERRAIN_GRASS * TERRAIN_STEP) / 100.0)
    
    penalty_component = -0.01 * (state[6] + state[13])  # Re-scaled and re-signed to encourage better solutions
    
    reward = moving_forward_rewards - 0.05 * distance_to_goal + penalty_component
    
    individual_reward = {"progress": -0.05 * distance_to_goal, "moving_forward": moving_forward_rewards, "penalty": penalty_component}
    
    return reward, individual_reward
```

In this proposal:

* The moving forward rewards are re-scaled using the hyperbolic tangent (tanh) function to have a more significant impact on the overall reward.
* The penalty component is re-scaled and re-signed to encourage better solutions by minimizing its value.
* The distance-to-goal component is now multiplied by a negative coefficient (-0.05) to discourage the agent from moving away from the goal.

This new reward function should encourage the agent to move forward, avoid penalties, and converge towards the optimal solution.
