Based on the provided policy feedback, I'll analyze each existing reward component and suggest improvements.

**Analyzing existing reward components**

1. `moving_forward`: The values seem to be unrelated to the actual movement progress, making it unclear what this component aims to achieve.
2. `penalty`: The values are relatively consistent, indicating a penalty for not achieving some goal. However, the maximum value is significantly higher than the mean and minimum, suggesting that the penalty should be scaled down.
3. `fitness_score`: This component seems to be the ground truth evaluator, but its values are negative and decreasing, which may not encourage the agent to maximize it during training.

**Proposed new reward function**

To better solve the task, I suggest a new reward function that encourages the agent to move forward while minimizing penalties and maximizing the fitness score. The goal is to create a well-balanced reward scheme.

Here's my proposed code:
```python
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    distance_to_goal = abs(pos[0] - TERRAIN_LENGTH)
    moving_forward = not self.game_over and (pos[0] < 0 or pos[0] > TERRAIN_GRASS * TERRAIN_STEP)

    # Scale down the penalty component
    penalty = -0.001 * (state[6] + state[13])

    # Create a weighted combination of components
    reward = np.exp(-(distance_to_goal ** 2) / 1000) * 0.5 + moving_forward * 0.3 + penalty

    individual_reward = {"progress": np.exp(-(distance_to_goal ** 2) / 1000), 
                          "moving_forward": moving_forward, 
                          "penalty": penalty}

    return reward, individual_reward
```
Key changes:

* I removed the `fitness_score` component since it's not clear how to use it in the context of this task.
* I scaled down the `penalty` component by a factor of 0.001 to reduce its impact on the overall reward.
* I introduced a weighted combination of components, where:
	+ The progress towards the goal is still encouraged (0.5).
	+ Moving forward receives a moderate bonus (0.3).
	+ Penalty for not achieving some goal is reduced but still present.

This new reward function aims to balance exploration and exploitation, encouraging the agent to move forward while minimizing penalties and maximizing progress.

Please note that this is just a proposal, and you may need to adjust or fine-tune the reward function based on your specific task and requirements.
