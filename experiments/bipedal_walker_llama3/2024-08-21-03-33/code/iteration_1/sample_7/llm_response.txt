Based on the provided feedback, I'll analyze each existing reward component and then propose a new reward function.

**Analysis of Existing Reward Components**

1. **moving_forward**: The values are quite scattered, which suggests that this component might not be providing consistent information about the agent's performance.
2. **penalty**: The values are mostly around 9.9-10.0, indicating that the penalty is relatively constant and not providing much variation in the reward signal.
3. **fitness_score**: This is the ground truth evaluator, and we want to maximize it. However, the values are mostly negative, which suggests that the agent has been penalized more often than rewarded during training.
4. **reward**: The values are similar to those of **penalty**, indicating that this component might not be providing a strong enough reward signal.

**New Reward Function Proposal**

Based on the analysis above, I propose the following new reward function:

```python
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    distance_to_goal = abs(pos[0] - TERRAIN_LENGTH)
    
    # Adjust the magnitude of moving_forward to make it more significant
    moving_forward_reward = 10.0 * (1 if pos[0] > TERRAIN_GRASS * TERRAIN_STEP else 0)
    
    # Scale down the penalty component to avoid overwhelming the reward signal
    penalty = -0.005 * (state[6] + state[13])
    
    # Maximize the fitness score by adding a positive reward term
    fitness_score_reward = 10.0 * np.exp(-np.abs(fitness_score))
    
    total_reward = moving_forward_reward + penalty + fitness_score_reward
    
    individual_rewards = {
        "progress": np.exp(-(distance_to_goal ** 2) / 1000),
        "moving_forward": moving_forward_reward,
        "penalty": penalty,
        "fitness_score": fitness_score_reward
    }
    
    return total_reward, individual_rewards
```

**Key Changes**

1. I've adjusted the magnitude of **moving_forward** to make it more significant in the reward signal.
2. I've scaled down the **penalty** component to avoid overwhelming the reward signal.
3. I've added a positive reward term to maximize the **fitness_score**, which is the ground truth evaluator.

These changes should help the agent focus on making progress, while avoiding penalties and maximizing the fitness score.
