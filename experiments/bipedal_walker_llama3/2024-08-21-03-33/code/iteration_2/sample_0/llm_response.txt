Analyzing the existing reward components:

1. `moving_forward`: The values are increasing when they should decrease (minimize). This suggests that this component is not well-designed to encourage moving forward.
2. `penalty`: The values are all around 9-10, indicating a consistent penalty for some reason. However, since the fitness score is supposed to be maximized, we need to re-evaluate whether this penalty is helping or hindering progress.
3. `fitness_score`: This is the ground truth evaluator and should be the target of our optimization. The values are negative, indicating that the agent is not performing well.

New reward function proposal:
```
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    distance_to_goal = abs(pos[0] - TERRAIN_LENGTH)
    progress_reward = np.exp(-(distance_to_goal ** 2) / 1000)  # Encourage moving towards the goal
    
    penalty = -0.01 * (state[6] + state[13])  # Keep this as a penalty term, but re-scale it
    
    fitness_score = -fitness_score_func(pos, action, state)  # Use the ground truth evaluator as a target
    
    return progress_reward + penalty + fitness_score, {"progress": progress_reward, "penalty": penalty, "fitness_score": fitness_score}
```
Changes made:

* Re-designed `moving_forward` component to encourage movement towards the goal.
* Retained the `penalty` term but re-scaled it to be a smaller contribution to the overall reward.
* Added the `fitness_score` as a target term to help the agent optimize its performance.

This new reward function proposal aims to balance the encouragement of progress, penalization of undesirable states, and optimization towards the ground truth evaluator.
