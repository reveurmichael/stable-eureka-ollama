Based on the analysis of the policy feedback, I propose an improved reward function to better solve the task. Here's my analysis and recommendation:

1. `moving_forward` component:
The values seem reasonable, but they are quite scattered. Considering this, I would re-scale this component to a smaller magnitude to avoid dominating the overall reward.

2. `penalty` component:
The penalty values are consistent with trying to minimize them. The maximum value is close to the mean, indicating that the agent should focus on minimizing the penalty. However, the penalty magnitude seems high compared to other components. I would re-scale this component to a smaller magnitude to avoid dominating the overall reward.

3. `fitness_score` component:
The values are highly negative, which means the agent should try to maximize them (i.e., increase the fitness score). The large variance in these values might make it difficult for the agent to learn. I would re-scale this component to a smaller magnitude and consider using a logarithmic transformation to reduce the impact of extreme values.

4. `episode_length` component:
The episode length is constant, indicating that the agent should try to minimize it (i.e., complete the episode as quickly as possible). This component can be discarded since it's not providing any meaningful feedback for learning.

Based on these observations, I propose a new reward function:

```
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    distance_to_goal = abs(pos[0] - TERRAIN_LENGTH)
    moving_forward = not self.game_over and (pos[0] < 0 or pos[0] > TERRAIN_GRASS * TERRAIN_STEP)

    fitness_score_reward = np.log1p(np.exp(fitness_score))  # Logarithmic transformation
    fitness_score_reward *= 0.01  # Re-scale to a smaller magnitude

    reward = np.exp(-(distance_to_goal ** 2) / 1000) * (1 if moving_forward else 0.5) - 0.001 * state[6] - 0.001 * state[13] + fitness_score_reward
    individual_reward = {"progress": np.exp(-(distance_to_goal ** 2) / 1000), "moving_forward": 1 if moving_forward else 0, "penalty": -0.001 * (state[6] + state[13]), "fitness_score": fitness_score_reward}

    return reward, individual_reward
```

This new reward function aims to:

* Encourage the agent to move forward and make progress toward the goal while minimizing the distance to the goal.
* Minimize the penalty by reducing state values [6] and [13].
* Maximize the fitness score by increasing its logarithmic transformation.

The next training will take the best model weights, reusing some of the relevant information from the previous training.
