Based on the provided policy feedback, I'll analyze each existing reward component and propose an improved reward function.

**Analyzing Existing Reward Components**

1. `moving_forward`: This component has a high mean value (421.95), indicating that it's often positive during training. However, its maximum value is 1570.0, which is quite large compared to the other components. To scale this down, I'll divide it by 10.
2. `penalty`: The magnitude of this component is relatively consistent across episodes, with a mean value around -9.9465. This suggests that the penalty term should remain unchanged, as it seems to be providing a reasonable trade-off between exploration and exploitation.
3. `fitness_score`: Unfortunately, this component has a very low mean value (-86.0426), which indicates that the fitness score is not improving during training. To address this, I'll use this component to drive the reward function's overall direction (i.e., maximize it).
4. `reward` (the one provided by Stable-Eureka): This component seems to be a combination of distance-to-goal and movement rewards. However, its values are highly correlated with those of `moving_forward`, suggesting that they might be redundant.
5. `episode_length`: This component has a constant value of 1600.0 across all episodes, which means it's not providing any useful information for the reward function.

**Proposed Improved Reward Function**

Based on my analysis, I propose the following improved reward function:
```python
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    distance_to_goal = abs(pos[0] - TERRAIN_LENGTH)
    fitness_score_reward = 10 * (1 + np.tanh((fitness_score() - min_fitness) / 5))  # maximize fitness score
    moving_forward_reward = (moving_forward() / 10)  # scale down movement reward
    penalty_term = -0.01 * (state[6] + state[13])  # keep the same penalty term

    individual_rewards = {"fitness_score": fitness_score_reward, "movement": moving_forward_reward, "penalty": penalty_term}

    return np.sum(individual_rewards.values()), individual_rewards
```
**Changes Made**

* Replaced `reward` with a combination of three components: `fitness_score`, `moving_forward`, and `penalty`.
* Scaled down the movement reward by dividing it by 10.
* Used the fitness score to drive the overall direction of the reward function (maximize it).
* Introduced a hyperbolic tangent function (`np.tanh`) to smoothly transition the reward from negative values (when the fitness score is low) to positive values (when the fitness score is high). This should help the agent focus on improving its fitness score.

**Next Steps**

Train the new reward function with the same model architecture and hyperparameters. This will allow the agent to learn a better policy based on the improved reward function.
