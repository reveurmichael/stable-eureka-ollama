Based on the provided policy feedback and the existing reward function, I'll analyze each component and provide a revised reward function to better solve the task.

**Analysis of Existing Reward Components**

1. **penalty**: The values are similar, suggesting that the penalty term might not be effective in guiding the agent's behavior. Considering option (a) - change its scale or temperature parameter.
2. **reward**: The values seem reasonable, but the magnitude is quite small compared to other components. Re-scaling it might help.
3. **fitness_score**: This component should be maximized, as it's the ground truth evaluator.

**Revised Reward Function**

To better guide the agent's behavior and maximize the fitness score, I propose the following revised reward function:

```
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    distance_to_goal = abs(pos[0] - TERRAIN_LENGTH)
    moving_forward = not self.game_over and (pos[0] < 0 or pos[0] > TERRAIN_GRASS * TERRAIN_STEP)

    # Re-weight the penalty term
    penalty = -0.001 * (state[6] + state[13])

    # Re-scale the reward component
    reward = np.exp(-(distance_to_goal ** 2) / 1000) * (1 if moving_forward else 0.5) + 0.01

    individual_reward = {"progress": np.exp(-(distance_to_goal ** 2) / 1000), "moving_forward": 1 if moving_forward else 0, "penalty": penalty, "fitness_reward": 0.1 * (state[7] - state[8])}

    return reward, individual_reward
```

**Changes Made**

* Re-weighted the penalty term to make it more significant in guiding the agent's behavior.
* Re-scaled the reward component to increase its magnitude and significance.
* Introduced a new "fitness_reward" term that rewards the agent for making progress towards the goal (i.e., increasing state[7] and decreasing state[8]). This should help maximize the fitness score.

This revised reward function should provide better guidance for the agent's behavior, leading to improved performance and more effective exploration.
