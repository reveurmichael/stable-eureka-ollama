A new challenge!

Let's analyze each existing reward component:

1. **fitness_score**: This is the ground truth evaluator and should be maximized during training. However, its values are quite low (mostly around -80 to -90). This could indicate that the agent is not performing well in terms of fitness.
2. **moving_forward**: The values seem reasonable, with a maximum value of 1570.0 and a mean value of 421.95. There's no obvious issue here.
3. **penalty**: The values are all quite close to each other (around 9.9-10.1), which might indicate that this component is not contributing much to the overall reward signal. We could consider re-scaling or re-writing this component.
4. **reward**: This component's values seem reasonable, with a maximum value of 10.06 and a mean value of 9.9464. There's no obvious issue here.

Based on these observations, I propose a new reward function that incorporates the insights from the previous training:

```python
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    distance_to_goal = abs(pos[0] - TERRAIN_LENGTH)
    moving_forward = not self.game_over and (pos[0] < 0 or pos[0] > TERRAIN_GRASS * TERRAIN_STEP)

    # Scale the fitness score to make it more relevant
    fitness_score_reward = np.exp(-(fitness_score ** 2) / 1000000)  # Adjust the exponent here

    # Reward progress towards the goal
    progress_reward = np.exp(-(distance_to_goal ** 2) / 10000)

    # Penalty for not moving forward (similar to the original penalty component)
    penalty = -0.01 * (state[6] + state[13])

    # Combine the rewards with weights
    reward = 0.8 * fitness_score_reward + 0.1 * progress_reward + 0.1 * penalty

    individual_reward = {"fitness_score": fitness_score_reward, "progress": progress_reward, "penalty": penalty}

    return reward, individual_reward
```

The new reward function:

* Scales the fitness score to make it more relevant ( adjust the exponent here)
* Introduces a new `progress_reward` term that encourages movement towards the goal
* Keeps the original `penalty` component, but with a lower weight

This revised reward function aims to balance the agent's performance in terms of fitness, progress towards the goal, and penalty for not moving forward.
