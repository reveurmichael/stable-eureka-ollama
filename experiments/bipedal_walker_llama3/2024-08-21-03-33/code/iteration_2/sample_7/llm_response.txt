Based on the provided feedback, I'll analyze each existing reward component and propose an improved reward function.

**Penalty Component Analysis**

The penalty values are relatively close to each other, with a mean value of -0.0054. This suggests that the penalty term might be too weak or not well-defined for the task. To improve this component:

* Scale the penalty term by increasing its magnitude (e.g., multiply it by 10-20).

**Fitness Score Component Analysis**

The fitness score values are negative and have a large range (-100 to -53). This suggests that the reward function should prioritize maximizing the fitness score.

* Make the fitness score component more prominent in the reward function.

**Moving Forward Component Analysis**

This component is relatively simple, with values ranging from 7.5 to 1570. The mean value is around 422, which seems reasonable for a moving forward reward.

* No changes needed here.

**New Reward Function Proposal**

Considering the analysis above, I propose an improved reward function that combines the moving forward and fitness score components while scaling the penalty term:
```python
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    distance_to_goal = abs(pos[0] - TERRAIN_LENGTH)
    moving_forward = not self.game_over and (pos[0] < 0 or pos[0] > TERRAIN_GRASS * TERRAIN_STEP)

    reward = 0.1 * np.exp(-(distance_to_goal ** 2) / 1000) + 0.9 * fitness_score - 10.0 * (state[6] + state[13])

    individual_reward = {"progress": 0.1 * np.exp(-(distance_to_goal ** 2) / 1000), "moving_forward": 0 if not moving_forward else 0.5, "penalty": -10.0 * (state[6] + state[13]), "fitness_score": fitness_score}

    return reward, individual_reward
```
This new reward function:

1. Scales the penalty term to increase its magnitude.
2. Makes the fitness score component more prominent by multiplying it by 0.9.
3. Keeps the moving forward component relatively simple.

Note that you may need to adjust the weights and scales in this proposal to suit your specific task and environment.
