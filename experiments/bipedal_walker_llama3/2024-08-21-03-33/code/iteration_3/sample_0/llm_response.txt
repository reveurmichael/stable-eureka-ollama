A delightful challenge!

Let's analyze each existing reward component:

1. `moving_forward`: The values are quite diverse, ranging from 7.5 to 1570.0. This suggests that this component might be related to progress towards the goal.
2. `penalty`: The values are all negative and quite similar, with a mean of approximately -9.95. This component seems to be related to some kind of penalty or cost.
3. `fitness_score`: These values are highly negative, ranging from -53.74 to -100.94. As the goal is to maximize this score, it's likely that this component should have a positive weight in the reward function.

Now, let's write a new reward function proposal:

```python
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    progress = (pos[0] / TERRAIN_LENGTH) ** 2  # Normalize progress towards goal
    penalty = -0.01 * (state[6] + state[13])  # Scale and normalize penalty term
    fitness_score_bonus = 0.1 * (1 - np.abs(fitness_score))  # Incentivize improving fitness score

    reward = progress + penalty + fitness_score_bonus
    
    individual_reward = {"progress": progress, "penalty": penalty, "fitness_score_bonus": fitness_score_bonus}
    
    return reward, individual_reward
```

Key changes:

* We've normalized the `moving_forward` component to emphasize progress towards the goal.
* The `penalty` term is now scaled and normalized to have a smaller impact on the overall reward.
* We've added a bonus term for improving the fitness score, which should incentivize the agent to maximize this score.

This new reward function proposal aims to balance the competing goals of moving forward, minimizing penalty, and maximizing the fitness score. The next training iteration will use these weights as a starting point, so let's hope it leads to improved performance!
