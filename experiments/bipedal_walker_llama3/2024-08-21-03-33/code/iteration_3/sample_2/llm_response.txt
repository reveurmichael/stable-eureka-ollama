A challenging task! Let's analyze each existing reward component:

1. `moving_forward`: The values seem reasonable, with a mean value of 421.95. This component seems to be encouraging the agent to move forward.

2. `penalty`: The values are mostly around 9.94, with a maximum value of 10.06. This suggests that there might be some issues with this component, as it's not providing much contrast between good and bad behavior. I'll consider scaling or rewriting this component.

3. `fitness_score`: Unfortunately, the fitness scores are all negative, indicating that the agent is not making progress. This could indicate a problem with the environment or the reward function itself.

4. `reward`: The values seem to be mostly around 9.94, similar to the `penalty` component. This might indicate that these two components are redundant or have some issues.

5. `episode_length`: These values are all constant at 1600.0, which is likely due to the way the environment is structured. This component doesn't seem to be providing any meaningful information for training.

Considering the tips for analyzing feedback:

* For `penalty` and `reward`, I'll consider scaling or rewriting these components.
* Since `fitness_score` is not improving during training, I'll modify the reward function to better encourage progress.
* The `episode_length` component seems irrelevant for training, so I'll discard it.

Here's my proposal for a new reward function:
```python
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    distance_to_goal = abs(pos[0] - TERRAIN_LENGTH)
    moving_forward = not self.game_over and (pos[0] < 0 or pos[0] > TERRAIN_GRASS * TERRAIN_STEP)

    # Scale penalty to provide more contrast
    penalty = -10.0 * (state[6] + state[13])

    # Use fitness score as a target value for reward shaping
    target_fitness = -50.0  # Adjust this value based on your specific task

    # Calculate progress-based reward
    progress_reward = np.exp(-(distance_to_goal ** 2) / 1000)

    # Combine rewards with a weighted sum
    reward = (progress_reward + penalty) * moving_forward + target_fitness * (1 - moving_forward)

    individual_rewards = {
        "progress": progress_reward,
        "moving_forward": moving_forward,
        "penalty": penalty,
        "target_fitness": target_fitness
    }

    return reward, individual_rewards
```
In this new reward function:

* I've scaled the `penalty` component to provide more contrast between good and bad behavior.
* I've used the `fitness_score` as a target value for reward shaping, encouraging the agent to improve its performance.
* The `progress_reward` component is based on the distance to the goal, with a decaying exponential function to encourage the agent to move forward.
* The `moving_forward` component is used to weight the progress-based reward and penalty.

This new reward function should provide a better guidance for training the agent.
