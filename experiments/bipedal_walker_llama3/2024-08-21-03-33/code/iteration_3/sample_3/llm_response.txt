Based on the provided policy feedback, I'll analyze each existing reward component and propose an improved reward function.

1. **Moving Forward**: The values seem reasonable, with most values ranging from 7.5 to 1570.0. This suggests that the "moving forward" component is well-designed.
2. **Penalty**: The penalty values are all around 9.9-10.06, which indicates that they're not providing enough distinction between good and bad actions. I'll discuss this further in the proposed reward function.
3. **Fitness Score**: This is the ground truth evaluator, so we should maximize it. However, the negative values indicate that the agent is currently being penalized for achieving a high fitness score. We need to reverse the penalty.
4. **Reward**: The reward values are similar to the moving forward component's, which suggests they're also well-designed.

To create an improved reward function, I'll consider the following:

* Re-scale the penalty term
* Reverse the penalty for the fitness score
* Combine the components into a single reward function

Here's the proposed reward code:
```python
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    distance_to_goal = abs(pos[0] - TERRAIN_LENGTH)
    moving_forward = not self.game_over and (pos[0] < 0 or pos[0] > TERRAIN_GRASS * TERRAIN_STEP)

    penalty_scale = 1.5  # Adjust the penalty scale as needed
    penalty = np.exp(-(state[6] + state[13]) / penalty_scale) - 0.01

    fitness_reward = np.exp(1.5 * (fitness_score - min(fitness_score))) - 0.001  # Reverse the penalty and scale it
    moving_forward_reward = np.exp(-(distance_to_goal ** 2) / 1000) * (1 if moving_forward else 0.5)

    reward = fitness_reward + moving_forward_reward - penalty

    individual_reward = {"progress": np.exp(-(distance_to_goal ** 2) / 1000), "moving_forward": 1 if moving_forward else 0, "penalty": penalty}
    
    return reward, individual_reward
```
In this proposal, I've:

* Re-scaled the penalty term using a variable `penalty_scale` to make it more distinct.
* Reversed the penalty for the fitness score by taking the negative exponential of the difference between the current and minimum fitness scores.
* Combined the components into a single reward function.

The new reward function aims to encourage the agent to move forward, achieve high fitness scores, and avoid penalties. The individual rewards are still provided for insight into the contribution of each component to the overall reward.
