Based on the provided policy feedback, I'll analyze each existing reward component and then write a new reward function code proposal.

1. **reward**: This component seems to be related to movement towards the goal (positive rewards) and penalty for staying close to obstacles or the terrain boundaries (negative penalties). The magnitude of this component is significant, so it should be scaled accordingly.
2. **penalty**: This component has a consistent value range (~9.9-10.0), which might indicate that it's not providing enough contrast with other components. Scaling this component down could help.
3. **moving_forward**: This component is binary (0 or 1) and seems to be related to the agent's progress towards the goal. It's important, but its magnitude is relatively small compared to others.
4. **fitness_score**: This is the ground truth evaluator, and we want to maximize it. However, its values are negative, which means we need to flip its sign during training.

After analyzing each component, I'll propose a new reward function that incorporates these insights:

**New Reward Function Code Proposal:**
```python
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    distance_to_goal = abs(pos[0] - TERRAIN_LENGTH)
    moving_forward = not self.game_over and (pos[0] < 0 or pos[0] > TERRAIN_GRASS * TERRAIN_STEP)

    # Scale the penalty component
    penalty = -0.001 * (state[6] + state[13])

    # Flip the sign of fitness_score to maximize it during training
    fitness_reward = -(fitness_score)

    # Combine components with weights
    reward = 0.5 * np.exp(-(distance_to_goal ** 2) / 1000) * (1 if moving_forward else 0) + 0.3 * penalty + 0.2 * fitness_reward

    individual_rewards = {"progress": np.exp(-(distance_to_goal ** 2) / 1000), "moving_forward": 1 if moving_forward else 0, "penalty": -0.001 * (state[6] + state[13]), "fitness": fitness_reward}

    return reward, individual_rewards
```
This new reward function:

* Scales down the penalty component to provide more contrast with other components.
* Flips the sign of the fitness_score to maximize it during training.
* Combines the three main components with weights (0.5 for progress, 0.3 for penalty, and 0.2 for fitness_reward).
* Keeps the individual rewards for debugging purposes.

This revised reward function should encourage the agent to move towards the goal while minimizing penalties and maximizing its overall performance.
