Based on the provided policy feedback and reward components, I'll analyze each component and provide a new reward function proposal.

**Analysis of Existing Reward Components**

1. **fitness_score**: This component aims to maximize the fitness score, which is the ground truth evaluator. However, its values are quite low (minimum -100.94), indicating that the current policy is not performing well. I'll keep this component as it is, as we want to maximize the fitness score.
2. **reward**: This component seems to be related to the distance to the goal and the moving forward action. The values are mostly positive, which is good. However, they're quite small (maximum 10.06), suggesting that the policy is not making significant progress towards the goal. I'll keep this component as it is.
3. **penalty**: This component seems to penalize the state features (state[6] and state[13]). The values are mostly around 9.94, indicating that the penalty term is dominant. This could be an issue if we're trying to maximize the fitness score. I'll modify this component later.
4. **episode_length**: This component simply counts the number of steps taken in each episode. It's not directly related to the policy performance, so I'll discard it.

**New Reward Function Proposal**

Based on the analysis above, I propose a new reward function that combines the positive aspects of the existing components:

```python
def compute_reward(self, state):
    distance_to_goal = abs(state[0] - TERRAIN_LENGTH)
    moving_forward = not self.game_over and (state[0] < 0 or state[0] > TERRAIN_GRASS * TERRAIN_STEP)
    
    reward = np.exp(-(distance_to_goal ** 2) / 1000) * (1 if moving_forward else 0.5) + 0.01 * fitness_score(state)
    
    individual_reward = {"progress": np.exp(-(distance_to_goal ** 2) / 1000), "moving_forward": 1 if moving_forward else 0, "fitness_bonus": 0.01 * fitness_score(state)}
    
    return reward, individual_reward
```

**Changes**

* I removed the penalty term from the reward function, as it's currently dominant and may hinder the policy performance.
* I added a bonus term based on the fitness score, which we want to maximize. This should encourage the policy to make progress towards the goal.

**Next Steps**

Now that we have a new reward function proposal, we can use it for the next training iteration. The next training will take the best model weights from this iteration, so it will build upon the knowledge gained during this analysis.
