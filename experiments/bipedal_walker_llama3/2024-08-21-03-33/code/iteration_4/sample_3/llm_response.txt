Based on the provided feedback and analysis guidelines, I'll analyze each existing reward component and propose a new reward function.

**Analyzing Existing Reward Components**

1. **moving_forward**: This component seems to be encouraging the agent to move forward. However, its values are quite large, which might lead to overemphasis on moving forward. Consider scaling it down.
2. **penalty**: The penalty component is designed to discourage certain states or actions. Its magnitude is relatively small compared to other components. This suggests that it might not have a significant impact on the agent's behavior. However, it could still be useful in conjunction with other reward components.
3. **fitness_score**: This component is the ground truth evaluator and should be maximized. However, its values are negative, which means the agent is being penalized for achieving higher fitness scores. This is counterintuitive and might not encourage the agent to improve its performance.

**Proposed New Reward Function**

Based on the analysis, I propose a new reward function that takes into account the goals of maximizing positive rewards and minimizing negative ones:

```
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    # Encourage moving forward
    moving_forward_reward = np.exp(-(abs(pos[0] - TERRAIN_LENGTH)) / 100) * (1 if abs(pos[0] - TERRAIN_LENGTH) < 50 else 0)

    # Penalty for not achieving fitness score
    penalty_for_low_fitness = -0.001 * state[6]

    # Reward for achieving high fitness score
    reward_for_high_fitness = np.exp((state[6] / 100)) * (1 if state[6] > 50 else 0)

    # Combine the rewards
    total_reward = moving_forward_reward + penalty_for_low_fitness + reward_for_high_fitness

    individual_rewards = {
        "moving_forward": moving_forward_reward,
        "fitness_penalty": penalty_for_low_fitness,
        "fitness_reward": reward_for_high_fitness
    }

    return total_reward, individual_rewards
```

This new reward function:

* Encourages the agent to move forward by rewarding it for being close to the goal.
* Introduces a penalty for not achieving a high fitness score (i.e., not improving its performance).
* Rewards the agent for achieving a high fitness score, which aligns with the ground truth evaluator.

The new reward function should provide a better incentive structure for the agent to learn and improve.
