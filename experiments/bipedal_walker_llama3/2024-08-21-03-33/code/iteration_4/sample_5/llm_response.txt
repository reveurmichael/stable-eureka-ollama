Analyzing the existing reward components:

1. `moving_forward`: The values are not identical, but they seem to be mostly increasing, which suggests that this component should indeed increase when the agent moves forward.
2. `penalty`: The values are all quite high, and there's no obvious pattern. This might indicate that the penalty is too harsh or too frequent. I'll re-scale it later.
3. `fitness_score`: These values are highly negative, which means the fitness score is not encouraging exploration or good behaviors.

New Reward Function Proposal:
```
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    distance_to_goal = abs(pos[0] - TERRAIN_LENGTH)
    moving_forward = not self.game_over and (pos[0] < 0 or pos[0] > TERRAIN_GRASS * TERRAIN_STEP)

    # Adjust the penalty to be less harsh
    penalty = -0.001 * (state[6] + state[13])

    # Scale the fitness score by a factor of 10 for better exploration
    fitness_score = 10 * np.exp(-np.abs(fitness_score) / 100)

    # Combine the components with weights
    reward = 0.5 * np.exp(-(distance_to_goal ** 2) / 1000) + 0.3 * (1 if moving_forward else 0) - 0.4 * penalty - 0.1 * fitness_score

    individual_reward = {"progress": 0.5 * np.exp(-(distance_to_goal ** 2) / 1000), "moving_forward": 0.3 * (1 if moving_forward else 0), "penalty": -0.4 * penalty, "fitness_score": -0.1 * fitness_score}

    return reward, individual_reward
```
Changes:

* Reduced the penalty magnitude by a factor of 10 to make it less harsh.
* Scaled the fitness score by a factor of 10 to encourage exploration and better behaviors.
* Combined the components using weighted sums, with `progress` and `moving_forward` being more important for positive rewards, and `penalty` and `fitness_score` being more important for negative rewards.

This new reward function should incentivize the agent to move forward, explore, and avoid penalties while improving its fitness score.
