After analyzing the feedback, I noticed that:

1. The `penalty` component has very similar values, indicating that it's not providing significant feedback to the agent.
2. The `fitness_score` component has a large range of negative values, but its mean value is quite low (-86.04). This could be an indication that the agent is not making progress in terms of fitness score.
3. The `reward` component has very similar values as well, indicating that it's not providing significant feedback to the agent.

Based on these observations, I propose a new reward function:

```
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    distance_to_goal = abs(pos[0] - TERRAIN_LENGTH)
    moving_forward = (pos[0] > 0) and (pos[0] < TERRAIN_GRASS * TERRAIN_STEP)

    # Scale the penalty term to be more significant
    penalty = -0.1 * (state[6] + state[13])

    # Adjust the progress reward to focus on moving forward
    progress = np.exp(-(distance_to_goal ** 2) / 500) if moving_forward else 0

    # Set a higher reward for reaching the goal
    goal_reached = int(pos[0] >= TERRAIN_GRASS * TERRAIN_STEP)
    goal_reward = 10.0 * goal_reached

    # Combine the components
    reward = progress + penalty + goal_reward

    individual_reward = {"progress": progress, "moving_forward": moving_forward, "penalty": penalty, "goal_reached": goal_reached}

    return reward, individual_reward
```

In this new reward function:

* I scaled up the penalty term to make it more significant.
* I adjusted the progress reward to focus on moving forward and decreased its magnitude to encourage more exploration.
* I added a new component that rewards the agent for reaching the goal with a high value (10.0).
* The individual_reward dictionary now includes separate entries for each component.

This new reward function should provide better feedback to the agent, encouraging it to move forward and explore the environment while avoiding penalties and striving to reach the goal.
