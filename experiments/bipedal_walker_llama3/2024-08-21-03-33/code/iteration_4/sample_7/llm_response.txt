Let's analyze each existing reward component:

1. `moving_forward`: The values seem to be related to progress towards the goal. This component seems to be encouraging the agent to move forward, which is a good thing.

2. `penalty`: The values are quite high and mostly above 0.5. This suggests that the penalty for not moving forward is dominating the reward signal. We might want to scale this down or re-write it to provide more nuanced feedback.

3. `fitness_score`: Unfortunately, we can't use this as a reward function directly because it's an evaluation metric rather than a reward signal. However, we do want to maximize the fitness score, which means we should encourage behaviors that lead to high scores during training.

4. `episode_length`: This component seems irrelevant to the task and is always 1600.0. We can safely discard this.

Now, let's write a new reward function proposal based on our analysis:

```
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    distance_to_goal = abs(pos[0] - TERRAIN_LENGTH)
    
    # Reward progress towards the goal
    progress_reward = np.exp(-(distance_to_goal ** 2) / 1000)
    
    # Encourage movement forward
    moving_forward_reward = 1 if pos[0] < 0 or pos[0] > TERRAIN_GRASS * TERRAIN_STEP else 0.5
    
    # Introduce a penalty for not making progress
    no_progress_penalty = -0.001 * (state[6] + state[13])
    
    # Combine the rewards and penalties
    reward = progress_reward * moving_forward_reward + no_progress_penalty
    
    individual_rewards = {"progress": progress_reward, "moving_forward": moving_forward_reward, "penalty": no_progress_penalty}
    
    return reward, individual_rewards
```

This new reward function aims to balance encouraging movement forward with the goal of maximizing the fitness score. It also introduces a penalty for not making progress towards the goal.
