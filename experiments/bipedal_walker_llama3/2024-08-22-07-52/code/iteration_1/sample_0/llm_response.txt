Based on the provided feedback, I will analyze each existing reward component and provide suggestions for improvement.

**1. Distance-based reward**: The values are quite large, which may indicate that this component is dominating the total reward. This could be due to the exponential scaling with a relatively small temperature parameter (400.0). Consider reducing the scaling or adjusting the temperature parameter to reduce the magnitude of this reward component.

**2. Stability and angular velocity penalties**: These components have similar magnitudes, which is interesting. The use of tanh for scaling suggests that these components are intended to be more stringent. However, the absolute values are relatively small. Consider increasing the impact of these components or re-scaling them to make them more significant.

**3. Smoothness reward**: This component has a relatively low magnitude and uses tanh for scaling with a relatively high temperature parameter (0.2). This suggests that smooth actions are not heavily penalized, which may be beneficial in certain situations. However, the absolute values are still quite small. Consider increasing the impact of this component or re-scaling it to make it more significant.

**4. Proximity to Lidar points**: The values for this component are relatively large, indicating that avoiding obstacles is an important aspect of the task. The use of exponential scaling suggests that this component should have a higher weight than others. This is supported by the provided feedback, which indicates that the fitness score improves when this reward component is maximized.

Considering these observations, I propose the following improved reward function code:

```
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    # Distance-based reward: incentivizing movement to the right
    distance_reward = pos.x / 400.0

    # Stability and angular velocity penalties: penalizing large angle and angular velocity
    stability_penalty = -np.abs(state[0])
    stability_penalty += -np.abs(state[1])  # Add both components together
    stability_penalty = np.tanh(stability_penalty / 0.5)  # More stringent scaling

    # Smoothness reward: penalizing high-speed actions
    action_penalty = -np.sum(np.abs(action)) / len(action)
    action_penalty = np.tanh(action_penalty / 0.1)  # Reduced impact for less stringent scaling

    # Proximity to Lidar points: encouraging avoidance of obstacles
    obstacle_penalty = -np.min([l.fraction for l in self.lidar])
    obstacle_penalty = np.exp(obstacle_penalty * 2.5)  # Increased weight and exponential scaling

    # Total reward: a weighted sum with adjusted weights
    reward = (distance_reward
              + 0.3 * stability_penalty
              + 0.1 * action_penalty
              + 0.6 * obstacle_penalty)  # Higher weight given to distance reward and obstacle penalty

    individual_reward = {
        "distance_reward": distance_reward,
        "stability_penalty": stability_penalty,
        "action_penalty": action_penalty,
        "obstacle_penalty": obstacle_penalty
    }

    return reward, individual_reward
```

Key changes include:

* Reduced the magnitude of the distance-based reward by dividing by 400.0.
* Combined the stability and angular velocity penalties to create a single component that penalizes both large angles and angular velocities.
* Increased the weight given to the obstacle penalty to reflect its importance in the task.
* Adjusted the scaling for the action penalty to make it more stringent.

These changes aim to better balance the different aspects of the task and provide a more effective reward function.
