Based on the provided feedback and analyzing each existing reward component:

1. `distance_reward`: The values are not identical, but they seem to be increasing consistently. This could be due to the exponential scaling used (`np.exp(distance_reward / 400.0) - 1`). Since this is a minimization task (maximize fitness score), consider reducing the impact of this component or re-writing it.

2. `angle_penalty` and `angular_velocity_penalty`: These components are penalizing large angles and angular velocities, respectively. The values seem to be decreasing consistently, which is good for minimizing these penalties. However, their magnitudes are significantly larger than others (e.g., `distance_reward`). Consider scaling them down or re-writing the components.

3. `action_penalty`: This component is penalizing high-speed actions. The values are not identical, but they seem to be decreasing consistently. This could be due to the tanh function (`np.tanh(action_penalty / 0.2)`). Since this is a minimization task (maximize fitness score), consider reducing the impact of this component or re-writing it.

4. `obstacle_penalty`: This component is penalizing proximity to Lidar points, encouraging avoidance of obstacles. The values seem to be decreasing consistently, which is good for minimizing these penalties. However, their magnitudes are significantly larger than others (e.g., `distance_reward`). Consider scaling them down or re-writing the components.

Based on these observations, I propose a new reward function code:

```
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    # Distance-based reward: incentivizing movement to the right
    distance_reward = pos.x / 400.0
    
    # Stability reward: penalizing large angle and angular velocity
    angle_penalty = -np.abs(state[0]) * 0.1
    angular_velocity_penalty = -np.abs(state[1]) * 0.05
    
    # Smoothness reward: penalizing high-speed actions
    action_penalty = -np.sum(np.abs(action)) / len(action) * 0.01
    
    # Proximity to Lidar points: encouraging avoidance of obstacles
    obstacle_penalty = -np.min([l.fraction for l in self.lidar]) * 0.5
    
    # Total reward: a weighted sum with adjusted weights
    reward = (distance_reward + 
              0.3 * angle_penalty + 
              0.1 * angular_velocity_penalty + 
              0.2 * action_penalty + 
              0.4 * obstacle_penalty)
    
    individual_reward = {
        "distance_reward": distance_reward,
        "angle_penalty": angle_penalty,
        "angular_velocity_penalty": angular_velocity_penalty,
        "action_penalty": action_penalty,
        "obstacle_penalty": obstacle_penalty
    }
    
    return reward, individual_reward
```

Key changes:

* Reduced the magnitude of `angle_penalty`, `angular_velocity_penalty`, and `action_penalty` to make them less dominant in the total reward.
* Increased the weight of `distance_reward` and `obstacle_penalty` to emphasize their importance.
* Replaced exponential scaling with linear scaling for `distance_reward` to make it more gradual.

This new reward function should encourage the agent to move to the right while maintaining stability, smoothness, and avoiding obstacles.
