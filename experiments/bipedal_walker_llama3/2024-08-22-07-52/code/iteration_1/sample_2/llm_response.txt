After analyzing the policy feedback and existing reward function, I've identified some areas for improvement. Here's a proposal for an updated reward function:

1. **Scale adjustments**: The magnitude of the "distance_reward" component is significantly larger than the others. To bring it into a similar range, I'll scale it down by 10.
2. **Re-weighting**: Observe that the "obstacle_penalty" has a much higher weight (0.5) compared to the other components. This suggests that avoiding obstacles is crucial for success. To emphasize this aspect, I'll increase its weight to 1.0.
3. **Penalty adjustments**: The "angle_penalty", "angular_velocity_penalty", and "action_penalty" components are designed to penalize undesirable behaviors. However, their impact seems relatively small compared to the distance reward and obstacle penalty. To increase their effectiveness, I'll multiply each by a factor of 2.

Here's the updated reward function code proposal:
```python
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    # Distance-based reward: incentivizing movement to the right (scaled down)
    distance_reward = pos.x / 10.0
    
    # Stability reward: penalizing large angle and angular velocity (increased impact)
    angle_penalty = -2 * np.abs(state[0])
    angle_penalty = np.tanh(angle_penalty / 0.5)  # More stringent scaling
    
    angular_velocity_penalty = -2 * np.abs(state[1])
    angular_velocity_penalty = np.tanh(angular_velocity_penalty / 0.5)  # Increased impact with stringent scaling
    
    # Smoothness reward: penalizing high-speed actions (increased impact)
    action_penalty = -2 * np.sum(np.abs(action)) / len(action)
    action_penalty = np.tanh(action_penalty / 0.2)  # Reduced impact for less stringent scaling
    
    # Proximity to Lidar points: encouraging avoidance of obstacles
    obstacle_penalty = -np.min([l.fraction for l in self.lidar])
    obstacle_penalty = np.exp(obstacle_penalty)  # Exponential scaling for higher penalty with increased weight
    
    # Total reward: a weighted sum with adjusted weights
    reward = (distance_reward + 
              0.2 * angle_penalty + 
              0.1 * angular_velocity_penalty + 
              0.3 * action_penalty + 
              1.0 * obstacle_penalty)  # Higher weight given to obstacle penalty
    
    individual_reward = {
        "distance_reward": distance_reward,
        "angle_penalty": angle_penalty,
        "angular_velocity_penalty": angular_velocity_penalty,
        "action_penalty": action_penalty,
        "obstacle_penalty": obstacle_penalty
    }
    
    return reward, individual_reward
```
This updated reward function should better align with the desired behavior and improve the policy's performance.
