Let's analyze each existing reward component:

1. **Distance-based reward**: The values are quite scattered, but the scale seems reasonable (max value around 400). This component appears to be functioning well.
2. **Stability reward** (angle and angular velocity): The magnitude of these penalties is quite high (up to -1). However, the scaling using `np.tanh` helps to reduce their impact at smaller values. This component seems effective in discouraging large angle and angular velocity changes.
3. **Smoothness reward** (action penalty): The maximum value is relatively low (-0.2), indicating that this component is designed to encourage smooth actions rather than punish them heavily. This looks like a good trade-off.
4. **Proximity to Lidar points**: The values are quite large and negative, suggesting that this component is intended to strongly penalize the agent for not avoiding obstacles.

Now, let's consider the overall reward function:

* The weightages seem reasonable, with distance-based reward having the highest weight (0.5), followed by proximity to lidar points (0.5).
* However, the stability and smoothness rewards have relatively low weights (0.2 and 0.1, respectively). This might indicate that the agent is not learning to prioritize these aspects.

To improve the reward function, I'll propose some changes:

**New Reward Function Code:**
```python
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    # Distance-based reward: incentivizing movement to the right
    distance_reward = pos.x
    
    # Stability and smoothness rewards:
    stability_penalty = -np.abs(state[0]) * 0.1
    smoothness_penalty = -np.sum(np.abs(action)) / len(action) * 0.05
    
    # Proximity to Lidar points: encouraging avoidance of obstacles
    obstacle_penalty = -np.min([l.fraction for l in self.lidar])
    
    # Total reward: a weighted sum with adjusted weights
    reward = (distance_reward
              + 0.3 * stability_penalty
              + 0.2 * smoothness_penalty
              + 0.5 * obstacle_penalty)
    
    individual_reward = {
        "distance_reward": distance_reward,
        "stability_penalty": stability_penalty,
        "smoothness_penalty": smoothness_penalty,
        "obstacle_penalty": obstacle_penalty
    }
    
    return reward, individual_reward
```
Changes:

* Increased the weight of stability and smoothness rewards to 0.3 and 0.2, respectively, to encourage the agent to prioritize these aspects.
* Reduced the overall scale of the stability and smoothness penalties by a factor of 10 (from -1 to -0.1) to prevent the agent from being heavily penalized for small mistakes.

These changes should help the agent learn to balance distance-based reward with stability, smoothness, and obstacle avoidance.
