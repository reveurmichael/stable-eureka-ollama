Based on the provided feedback, I'll analyze each component of the existing reward function and suggest improvements.

1. **Distance-based reward**: The values are increasing when they should be decreasing (minimizing). This suggests that the reward is not well-designed to encourage movement towards the goal.
2. **Stability reward**: The magnitude of this component is relatively small compared to others. Scaling it up might help.
3. **Smoothness reward**: The values are decreasing when they should be increasing (maximizing). This implies that the penalty for high-speed actions is too strong and needs to be re-weighted or re-designed.
4. **Proximity to Lidar points**: The magnitude of this component is quite large, which could dominate the other components. Scaling it down might help.

Considering these observations, I'll propose an improved reward function:
```python
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    # Distance-based reward: incentivizing movement towards goal (modified)
    distance_reward = np.exp(-pos.x / 400.0)  # Invert the original formula
    
    # Stability reward: scaling up to emphasize importance
    angle_penalty = -np.abs(state[0]) * 10
    angular_velocity_penalty = -np.abs(state[1]) * 5
    
    # Smoothness reward: re-weighting and adjusting scaling
    action_reward = np.sum(np.abs(action)) / len(action) * 2
    
    # Proximity to Lidar points: scaling down for reduced impact
    obstacle_penalty = -np.min([l.fraction for l in self.lidar]) * 0.5
    
    # Total reward: a weighted sum with adjusted weights
    reward = (distance_reward
              + 0.2 * angle_penalty
              + 0.1 * angular_velocity_penalty
              + 0.4 * action_reward
              + 0.3 * obstacle_penalty)  # Adjusted weights for better balance
    
    individual_reward = {
        "distance_reward": distance_reward,
        "angle_penalty": angle_penalty,
        "angular_velocity_penalty": angular_velocity_penalty,
        "action_reward": action_reward,
        "obstacle_penalty": obstacle_penalty
    }
    
    return reward, individual_reward
```
Key changes:

* Inverted the distance-based reward to encourage movement towards the goal.
* Scaled up the stability and smoothness rewards for increased emphasis.
* Re-weighted the smoothness reward to reduce its impact.
* Scaled down the proximity to Lidar points penalty for reduced impact.

This improved reward function should better align with the desired behavior and provide more informative feedback during training.
