Based on the provided feedback, I will analyze each existing reward component and propose modifications to improve the overall performance of the policy.

**Analysis**

1. **Distance-based reward**: The values are increasing as expected, but they seem to be relatively small compared to other components. This suggests that the distance reward might not be having a significant impact on the agent's behavior.
2. **Stability reward**: The angle and angular velocity penalties are decreasing with time, which is undesirable. This component seems to be too lenient, allowing for larger angles and velocities without penalization.
3. **Smoothness reward**: The action penalty is decreasing with time, indicating that high-speed actions are not being discouraged enough.
4. **Proximity to Lidar points (obstacle avoidance)**: The obstacle penalty is relatively small compared to the other components. This suggests that the agent might not be incentivized enough to avoid obstacles.

**Modified Reward Function Proposal**

Based on the analysis, I propose the following modifications:

```python
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    # Distance-based reward (increased weight and scaling)
    distance_reward = np.exp((pos.x - 800.0) / 400.0) - 1
    
    # Stability reward (more stringent penalty for large angles and velocities)
    angle_penalty = -np.abs(state[0])
    angular_velocity_penalty = -np.abs(state[1])
    
    angle_penalty = np.tanh(angle_penalty / 0.2)
    angular_velocity_penalty = np.tanh(angular_velocity_penalty / 0.3)
    
    # Smoothness reward (reduced impact for less stringent scaling)
    action_penalty = -np.sum(np.abs(action)) / len(action)
    action_penalty = np.tanh(action_penalty / 1.5)  # Increased impact
    
    # Proximity to Lidar points (obstacle avoidance) (increased weight and penalty)
    obstacle_penalty = -np.min([l.fraction for l in self.lidar])
    obstacle_penalty = np.exp(obstacle_penalty * 3.0)  # Higher penalty with increased weight
    
    # Total reward: a weighted sum with adjusted weights
    reward = (distance_reward * 0.4
              + angle_penalty * 0.2
              + angular_velocity_penalty * 0.1
              + action_penalty * 0.15
              + obstacle_penalty * 0.3)
    
    individual_reward = {
        "distance_reward": distance_reward,
        "angle_penalty": angle_penalty,
        "angular_velocity_penalty": angular_velocity_penalty,
        "action_penalty": action_penalty,
        "obstacle_penalty": obstacle_penalty
    }
    
    return reward, individual_reward
```

**Changes**

* Increased the weight of the distance-based reward to encourage movement towards the right.
* Adjusted the scaling and penalty for large angles and velocities in the stability reward to make it more stringent.
* Reduced the impact of high-speed actions in the smoothness reward while increasing the overall penalty.
* Increased the weight and penalty for obstacle avoidance to encourage the agent to avoid obstacles.

These modifications aim to balance the rewards, making them more effective in guiding the agent's behavior. The new reward function should lead to improved performance and a better fit with the desired policy.
