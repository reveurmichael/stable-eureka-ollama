What a fascinating task!

After analyzing the policy feedback and existing reward components, I've identified some areas for improvement. Here's my proposal for an updated reward function:

**Distance-based reward**: The current distance-based reward incentivizes movement to the right (scaled). This is good, but I'll make it more robust by considering both the position difference and the speed at which the agent moves.

**Stability reward**: The stability reward penalizes large angle and angular velocity. While this is important for obstacle avoidance, I'll reduce its magnitude to prevent over-penalization of small deviations.

**Smoothness reward**: The smoothness reward penalizes high-speed actions (scaled). This is good, but I'll increase the weight on it to encourage more gentle movements.

**Obstacle penalty**: The obstacle penalty encourages avoidance of obstacles. Since this is a crucial aspect of the task, I'll increase its magnitude and consider proximity to multiple obstacles rather than just one.

**Fitness score**: As you mentioned, maximizing the fitness score is essential. To achieve this, I'll add a component that rewards the agent for achieving higher fitness scores.

Here's the updated reward function code proposal:
```python
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    # Distance-based reward: incentivizing movement to the right (scaled) and considering speed
    distance_reward = (pos.x / 200.0) * (1 - np.abs(action[1]) / 5.0)
    
    # Stability reward: penalizing large angle and angular velocity (reduced magnitude)
    stability_penalty = -np.sum([np.abs(state[i]) * 0.005 for i in range(2)])  # reduce magnitude
    
    # Smoothness reward: penalizing high-speed actions (scaled) with increased weight
    smoothness_reward = -(np.sum(np.abs(action)) / len(action)) * 0.3
    
    # Obstacle penalty: encouraging avoidance of obstacles with increased magnitude and considering multiple obstacles
    obstacle_penalty = -min([l.fraction for l in self.lidar]) * 0.4
    
    # Fitness score reward: incentivizing higher fitness scores
    fitness_reward = np.clip(state[2], 0, 1) * 0.5
    
    # Total reward: a weighted sum with adjusted weights
    reward = (distance_reward + stability_penalty + smoothness_reward + obstacle_penalty + fitness_reward)
    
    individual_reward = {
        "distance_reward": distance_reward,
        "stability_penalty": stability_penalty,
        "smoothness_reward": smoothness_reward,
        "obstacle_penalty": obstacle_penalty,
        "fitness_reward": fitness_reward
    }
    
    return reward, individual_reward
```
This updated reward function should better balance the trade-offs between movement, stability, and obstacle avoidance while encouraging higher fitness scores.
