A challenging task!

After analyzing the policy feedback, I've identified some issues with the existing reward function. Here are my observations:

1. **Obstacle penalty**: The values of this component are highly negative, indicating that the agent is not penalized enough for colliding with obstacles.
2. **Fitness score**: The fitness score values are generally negative, which means the agent is not incentivized to achieve high fitness scores.
3. **Reward magnitude**: The reward values are spread over a wide range, from 5.78 (obstacle penalty) to 16.98 (distance reward). This suggests that the agent might be focusing too much on maximizing the distance reward and neglecting other components.
4. **Episode length**: The episode lengths are all 1600, which is likely due to the fact that the environment doesn't have a natural termination condition.

Based on these observations, I propose an updated reward function:
```python
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    # Distance-based reward: incentivizing movement to the right (scaled)
    distance_reward = pos.x / 200.0
    
    # Stability reward: penalizing large angle and angular velocity (reduced magnitude)
    angle_penalty = -np.abs(state[0]) * 0.01
    angular_velocity_penalty = -np.abs(state[1]) * 0.005
    
    # Smoothness reward: penalizing high-speed actions (scaled)
    action_penalty = -np.sum(np.abs(action)) / len(action) * 0.05
    
    # Obstacle penalty: increase the magnitude to discourage collisions
    obstacle_penalty = -np.min([l.fraction for l in self.lidar]) * 2.0
    
    # Fitness score: incentivize achieving high fitness scores
    fitness_reward = np.exp(self.fitness_score) / (1 + np.exp(self.fitness_score))
    
    # Episode length: penalize long episodes (assuming they're not optimal)
    episode_length_penalty = -state['episode_length'] / 1600.0
    
    # Total reward: a weighted sum with adjusted weights
    reward = (distance_reward * 0.3
              + angle_penalty * 0.2
              + angular_velocity_penalty * 0.1
              + action_penalty * 0.05
              + obstacle_penalty * 0.5
              + fitness_reward * 0.1
              + episode_length_penalty * 0.05)
    
    individual_reward = {
        "distance_reward": distance_reward,
        "angle_penalty": angle_penalty,
        "angular_velocity_penalty": angular_velocity_penalty,
        "action_penalty": action_penalty,
        "obstacle_penalty": obstacle_penalty,
        "fitness_reward": fitness_reward,
        "episode_length_penalty": episode_length_penalty
    }
    
    return reward, individual_reward
```
I made the following changes:

1. Increased the magnitude of the obstacle penalty to discourage collisions.
2. Introduced a fitness reward term that incentivizes achieving high fitness scores.
3. Added an episode length penalty term to penalize long episodes (assuming they're not optimal).
4. Adjusted the weights for each component to balance the rewards and penalties.

This updated reward function should provide a better incentive structure for the agent to learn and improve its performance.
