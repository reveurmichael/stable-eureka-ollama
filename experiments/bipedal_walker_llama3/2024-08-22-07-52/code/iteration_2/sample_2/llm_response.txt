Based on the provided feedback and tips for analyzing policy feedback, I'll analyze each existing reward component first, then write a new reward function proposal.

1. `reward`: The mean of this component is positive (13.36488611061434), indicating that it's intended to be a maximization task. However, its magnitude is relatively small compared to other components. To scale up the effect of this component, I'll multiply it by 10.

2. `obstacle_penalty`: This component has a large range (-71.5706919163467 to -40.42749310731854), indicating that the penalty for obstacles is not well-defined. I'll re-write this component using a more meaningful metric, such as the average distance from the robot to the nearest obstacle.

3. `fitness_score`: As mentioned in the tips, we want to maximize this component. However, its range is relatively small (-22.803068068012664 to -9.90103017578458). I'll scale up this component by multiplying it by 5.

4. `episode_length`: This component has a large range (1600.0 to 885.5), indicating that the episode length is not well-defined. In reinforcement learning, the goal is usually to maximize rewards rather than minimize episode lengths. I'll discard this component.

Here's the new reward function code proposal:

```
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    # Distance-based reward: incentivizing movement to the right (scaled)
    distance_reward = 10 * pos.x / 200.0
    
    # Smoothness reward: penalizing high-speed actions (scaled)
    action_penalty = -np.sum(np.abs(action)) / len(action) * 0.1
    
    # Proximity to Lidar points: encouraging avoidance of obstacles
    obstacle_distance_reward = np.min([l.fraction for l in self.lidar]) * 0.2
    
    # Fitness score reward: maximizing fitness (scaled)
    fitness_score_reward = 5 * np.mean(self.fitness_score) + 1.5 * np.max(self.fitness_score)
    
    # Total reward: a weighted sum with adjusted weights
    reward = distance_reward + 0.3 * action_penalty - 0.2 * obstacle_distance_reward + fitness_score_reward
    
    individual_reward = {
        "distance_reward": distance_reward,
        "action_penalty": action_penalty,
        "obstacle_distance_reward": obstacle_distance_reward,
        "fitness_score_reward": fitness_score_reward
    }
    
    return reward, individual_reward
```

This new reward function proposal combines the positive aspects of each component while discarding the episode length and re-writing the `obstacle_penalty` using a more meaningful metric. The `distance_reward`, `action_penalty`, and `obstacle_distance_reward` are scaled to have similar magnitudes, and the `fitness_score_reward` is maximized with a higher weight.
