Based on the provided feedback, I will analyze each component and propose an improved reward function.

**Obstacle Penalty**: The magnitude of this component is significantly larger than others. To better balance its importance, I suggest scaling it down while still maintaining its significance in the overall reward function.

**Fitness Score**: As the ground truth evaluator, we want to maximize the fitness score. However, its values are not increasing during training. This could be due to the current reward function not effectively incentivizing good actions. To address this, I will increase the magnitude of the components that contribute positively to the reward and reduce those that penalize negative behavior.

**Other Components**: The remaining components (distance-based, stability, smoothness) seem to be well-scaled and balanced. However, to further improve the reward function, I suggest re-weighting these components based on their relative importance in the task.

Here is the proposed new reward function:

```python
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    # Distance-based reward: incentivizing movement to the right (scaled)
    distance_reward = pos.x / 200.0

    # Stability reward: penalizing large angle and angular velocity (reduced magnitude)
    stability_penalty = -np.abs(state[0]) * 0.05
    angular_velocity_penalty = -np.abs(state[1]) * 0.01

    # Smoothness reward: penalizing high-speed actions (scaled)
    action_penalty = -np.sum(np.abs(action)) / len(action) * 0.03

    # Proximity to Lidar points: encouraging avoidance of obstacles
    obstacle_penalty = -np.min([l.fraction for l in self.lidar]) * 0.1

    # Fitness score: incentivizing good actions (increased magnitude)
    fitness_reward = np.sum(fitness_score) * 0.2

    # Total reward: a weighted sum with adjusted weights
    reward = (distance_reward + 0.15 * stability_penalty + 0.05 * angular_velocity_penalty
              + 0.03 * action_penalty + 0.1 * obstacle_penalty + fitness_reward)

    individual_reward = {
        "distance_reward": distance_reward,
        "stability_penalty": stability_penalty,
        "angular_velocity_penalty": angular_velocity_penalty,
        "action_penalty": action_penalty,
        "obstacle_penalty": obstacle_penalty,
        "fitness_reward": fitness_reward
    }

    return reward, individual_reward
```

In this proposal, I have:

1. Reduced the magnitude of the stability and smoothness penalties to better balance their importance.
2. Increased the magnitude of the fitness score reward to incentivize good actions during training.
3. Adjusted the weights for each component to prioritize distance-based rewards (movement to the right) and obstacle avoidance while still considering stability, smoothness, and fitness.

This new reward function aims to better align with the task's objectives and improve the policy feedback.
