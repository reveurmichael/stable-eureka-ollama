Analyzing the feedback:

1. The `fitness_score` component has a significant impact on the overall reward (mean of -19.637692127622422). This suggests that maximizing the fitness score should be a priority.

2. The `obstacle_penalty` component has a large range (-71.5706919163467 to -40.42749310731854) and is also highly impactful (mean of -67.62852730363629). This indicates that avoiding obstacles is crucial for success.

3. The `reward` component has a relatively narrow range (5.776792094868142 to 16.9772499075043), but its mean (-19.637692127622422) suggests it's not as important as the other two components.

4. The `episode_length` component is constant, which means it's not contributing meaningfully to the overall reward.

To improve the reward function, I'll focus on maximizing the fitness score and penalizing obstacles while maintaining the distance-based reward (although its impact is relatively small). Here's a revised reward code proposal:

```python
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    # Fitness score-based reward: incentivize high scores
    fitness_reward = np.exp(fitness_score) * 0.5
    
    # Obstacle penalty: penalize proximity to obstacles
    obstacle_penalty = -np.min([l.fraction for l in self.lidar]) * 1.2
    
    # Distance-based reward: incentivize movement to the right (scaled)
    distance_reward = pos.x / 200.0
    
    # Total reward: a weighted sum with adjusted weights
    reward = (fitness_reward + 0.3 * obstacle_penalty + 0.4 * distance_reward)
    
    individual_reward = {
        "fitness_reward": fitness_reward,
        "obstacle_penalty": obstacle_penalty,
        "distance_reward": distance_reward
    }
    
    return reward, individual_reward
```

In this revised reward function:

* The `fitness_score` component is now exponentially weighted to give more importance to high scores.
* The `obstacle_penalty` component has a larger weight (1.2) to emphasize the importance of avoiding obstacles.
* The `distance_reward` component still exists but with a lower weight (0.4) to maintain some incentive for moving in the right direction.

This revised reward function should better align with the policy feedback and improve the overall performance of the agent.
