A challenging task!

After analyzing the policy feedback, I've identified some issues with the existing reward function. Here's a breakdown of each component:

1. **distance_reward**: This component seems to be incentivizing movement to the right (scaled). However, its value range is quite large (-12.5428 to -8.8402), which might not provide enough guidance for the agent.
2. **angle_penalty** and **angular_velocity_penalty**: These components aim to penalize large angle and angular velocity, respectively. The values are quite low (-70.0743 to -40.4275), indicating that these penalties are relatively weak.
3. **action_penalty**: This component aims to penalize high-speed actions (scaled). The values range from -71.5707 to -9.9010, which suggests that this penalty is not strong enough to discourage high-speed actions.
4. **obstacle_penalty**: These components aim to encourage avoidance of obstacles. The values range from -71.5707 to -40.4275, indicating a significant difference in magnitude between the penalties.

To address these issues and improve the reward function, I propose the following modifications:

**New Reward Function:**
```python
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    # Distance-based reward: incentivizing movement to the right (scaled)
    distance_reward = pos.x / 200.0
    
    # Stability reward: penalizing large angle and angular velocity (reduced magnitude)
    angle_penalty = -np.abs(state[0]) * 0.005
    angular_velocity_penalty = -np.abs(state[1]) * 0.001
    
    # Smoothness reward: penalizing high-speed actions (scaled)
    action_penalty = -np.sum(np.abs(action)) / len(action) * 0.05
    
    # Proximity to Lidar points: encouraging avoidance of obstacles
    obstacle_penalty = -np.min([l.fraction for l in self.lidar]) * 0.5
    
    # Total reward: a weighted sum with adjusted weights
    reward = (distance_reward
              + 0.1 * angle_penalty
              + 0.05 * angular_velocity_penalty
              + 0.2 * action_penalty
              + 0.6 * obstacle_penalty)  # Higher weight given to distance reward and obstacle penalty
    
    individual_reward = {
        "distance_reward": distance_reward,
        "angle_penalty": angle_penalty,
        "angular_velocity_penalty": angular_velocity_penalty,
        "action_penalty": action_penalty,
        "obstacle_penalty": obstacle_penalty
    }
    
    return reward, individual_reward
```
Here's what I've changed:

* Reduced the magnitude of the **angle_penalty** and **angular_velocity_penalty** components to make them stronger.
* Increased the weight given to the **distance_reward** component to incentivize movement to the right more strongly.
* Decreased the weight given to the **action_penalty** component to reduce the penalty for high-speed actions.
* Increased the weight given to the **obstacle_penalty** component to encourage avoidance of obstacles more strongly.

These modifications aim to provide a better balance between exploration and exploitation, while also encouraging the agent to avoid obstacles.
