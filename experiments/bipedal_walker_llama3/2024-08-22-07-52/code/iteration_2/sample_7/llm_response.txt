Based on the provided feedback, I will analyze each existing reward component and propose a new reward function.

**Observe Penalty**
The magnitude of obstacle penalty values is significantly larger than other components. To better balance the rewards, we can rescale the obstacle penalty by dividing it by its maximum value (i.e., -71.5706919163467). This will help to reduce its impact on the overall reward while still encouraging obstacle avoidance.

**Fitness Score**
The fitness score values are not increasing during training, which suggests that the current reward function is not aligned with the desired behavior. To maximize the fitness score, we can use it as a primary component in the reward function and adjust its weight to be higher than other components.

**Other Components**
The distance-based reward, stability rewards (angle and angular velocity), and smoothness reward (action penalty) seem reasonable. The stability rewards are reduced in magnitude, which is a good approach to avoid over-penalizing the agent for minor oscillations.

Here's the proposed new reward function code:
```python
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    # Fitness score: maximize this during training
    fitness_reward = np.min(fitness_score) * 0.5
    
    # Obstacle penalty (rescaled)
    obstacle_penalty = -np.min(obstacle_penalty) / -71.5706919163467 * 0.2
    
    # Distance-based reward: incentivizing movement to the right (scaled)
    distance_reward = pos.x / 200.0
    
    # Stability rewards: penalizing large angle and angular velocity (reduced magnitude)
    angle_penalty = -np.abs(state[0]) * 0.05
    angular_velocity_penalty = -np.abs(state[1]) * 0.01
    
    # Smoothness reward: penalizing high-speed actions (scaled)
    action_penalty = -np.sum(np.abs(action)) / len(action) * 0.1
    
    # Total reward: a weighted sum with adjusted weights
    reward = (fitness_reward + distance_reward + angle_penalty + angular_velocity_penalty + action_penalty + obstacle_penalty)
    
    individual_reward = {
        "distance_reward": distance_reward,
        "angle_penalty": angle_penalty,
        "angular_velocity_penalty": angular_velocity_penalty,
        "action_penalty": action_penalty,
        "obstacle_penalty": obstacle_penalty
    }
    
    return reward, individual_reward
```
Note that I've introduced a new weight for the fitness score to maximize it during training. The other components have been reweighted to balance the rewards. The rescaled obstacle penalty will help avoid over-penalizing the agent for minor mistakes.
