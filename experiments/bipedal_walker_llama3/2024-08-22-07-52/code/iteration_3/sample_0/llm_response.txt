Based on the analysis of the policy feedback, I will propose an improved reward function. Here's my analysis and proposal:

**Obstacle Penalty**: The values are mostly negative and seem to be focused around -4.6 to -9.3. This suggests that the penalty should be increased to emphasize avoidance of obstacles.

**Fitness Score**: The values are all negative, indicating that the agent should minimize this score. However, since we want to maximize the fitness score, I will remove this component from the reward function.

**Reward**: The values range from -4.5 to -2.2, suggesting that a scale factor is needed to make the reward more meaningful.

**Episode Length**: This metric seems unrelated to the main task of navigating and avoiding obstacles. Therefore, I will discard it.

Here's my proposal for an improved reward function:
```python
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    # Distance-based reward: incentivizing movement to the right (scaled)
    distance_reward = pos.x / 200.0
    
    # Stability reward: penalizing large angle and angular velocity (reduced magnitude)
    angle_penalty = -np.abs(state[0]) * 0.001
    angular_velocity_penalty = -np.abs(state[1]) * 0.0005
    
    # Smoothness reward: penalizing high-speed actions (scaled)
    action_penalty = -np.sum(np.abs(action)) / len(action) * 0.01
    
    # Obstacle penalty: increased weight to emphasize avoidance
    obstacle_penalty = -np.min([l.fraction for l in self.lidar]) * 1.2
    
    # Total reward: a weighted sum with adjusted weights
    reward = (distance_reward
              + 0.2 * angle_penalty
              + 0.05 * angular_velocity_penalty
              + 0.15 * action_penalty
              + 0.6 * obstacle_penalty)
    
    individual_reward = {
        "distance_reward": distance_reward,
        "angle_penalty": angle_penalty,
        "angular_velocity_penalty": angular_velocity_penalty,
        "action_penalty": action_penalty,
        "obstacle_penalty": obstacle_penalty
    }
    
    return reward, individual_reward
```
The main changes are:

* Increased the weight of the obstacle penalty to emphasize avoidance.
* Reduced the weights of the stability and smoothness rewards to prioritize movement and obstacle avoidance.
* Removed the fitness score component since it's not aligned with the main task.

This improved reward function should encourage the agent to navigate while avoiding obstacles, which is the primary goal.
