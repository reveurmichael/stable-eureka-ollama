Based on the provided feedback data, I'll analyze each existing reward component and propose a new reward function.

**Analysis**

1. **Obstacle penalty**: The values are highly negative, indicating that the agent should avoid obstacles at all costs. This is good.
2. **Fitness score**: Since this is the ground truth evaluator, we want to maximize it. However, its magnitude is significantly larger than the other components, so we need to scale it.
3. **Reward**: The values are generally negative, indicating that the agent should minimize them. However, some values are quite high (e.g., -2.536154197528958). This suggests that the reward function might not be well-designed.
4. **Episode length**: The values are mostly constant, which may indicate that the episode length is not being effectively used as a reward component.

**Proposed New Reward Function**

To address the issues mentioned above, I propose the following new reward function:
```python
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    # Fitness score: scale it to match the other components' magnitude
    fitness_scale = -100.0  # adjust this value based on the desired magnitude
    fitness_score = fitness_scale * (fitness_score - np.mean(fitness_score))

    # Distance-based reward: incentivize movement to the right (scaled)
    distance_reward = pos.x / 200.0

    # Stability and smoothness rewards:
    angle_penalty = -np.abs(state[0]) * 0.005
    angular_velocity_penalty = -np.abs(state[1]) * 0.001
    action_penalty = -np.sum(np.abs(action)) / len(action) * 0.05

    # Obstacle penalty: keep it the same, as it's already well-designed
    obstacle_penalty = -np.min([l.fraction for l in self.lidar]) * 0.5

    # Episode length reward: incentivize shorter episodes (scaled)
    episode_length_reward = -episode_length / np.mean(episode_length) * 0.1

    # Total reward: a weighted sum with adjusted weights
    reward = (fitness_score + distance_reward + angle_penalty
              + angular_velocity_penalty + action_penalty
              + obstacle_penalty + episode_length_reward)

    individual_reward = {
        "distance_reward": distance_reward,
        "angle_penalty": angle_penalty,
        "angular_velocity_penalty": angular_velocity_penalty,
        "action_penalty": action_penalty,
        "obstacle_penalty": obstacle_penalty,
        "episode_length_reward": episode_length_reward
    }

    return reward, individual_reward
```
**Changes**

1. Scaled the fitness score to match the other components' magnitude.
2. Kept the distance-based reward and stability/sMOOTHNESS rewards similar to the original code.
3. Introduced an episode length reward that incentivizes shorter episodes.
4. Adjusted the weights in the total reward calculation.

This new reward function should better guide the agent towards optimizing the fitness score while also considering the other components' values.
