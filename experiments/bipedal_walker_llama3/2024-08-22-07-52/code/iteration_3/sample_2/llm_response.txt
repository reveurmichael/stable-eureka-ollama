Let's analyze the existing reward function and its components:

1. **Distance-based reward**: This component seems to be doing well, as it encourages movement to the right (scaled).
2. **Stability reward**: The angle and angular velocity penalties are reducing the magnitude of this component, which is good. However, the absolute value of state[0] and state[1] might not be the best metric for stability.
3. **Smoothness reward**: This component penalizes high-speed actions (scaled). It's doing its job well, but the magnitude might be too small to have a significant impact on the overall reward.
4. **Obstacle penalty**: This component is designed to encourage avoidance of obstacles, which is good. The minimum fraction of lidar points could be used as a better metric for proximity to obstacles.

Now, let's analyze the feedback:

* The fitness score is not improving during training, suggesting that the reward function might not be aligned with the desired behavior.
* The mean and max values of the obstacle penalty are significantly lower than those of the fitness score. This suggests that the obstacle penalty is too small or too noisy to have a significant impact on the overall reward.

Considering these observations and the tips for analyzing feedback, I propose the following changes:

1. Increase the magnitude of the smoothness reward by increasing the scaling factor (0.05) to make it more impactful.
2. Modify the stability reward to use a more meaningful metric for stability, such as the absolute difference between consecutive states or the magnitude of the state derivative.
3. Adjust the weights in the total reward calculation to prioritize the distance-based and obstacle penalties, as they seem to be more relevant to the desired behavior.

Here's the proposed new reward function:
```python
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    # Distance-based reward: incentivizing movement to the right (scaled)
    distance_reward = pos.x / 200.0
    
    # Stability reward: penalizing large stability deviations (adjusted metric)
    stability_penalty = -np.abs(state[0] - state[-1]) * 0.01
    
    # Smoothness reward: penalizing high-speed actions (increased magnitude)
    action_penalty = -np.sum(np.abs(action)) / len(action) * 0.2
    
    # Proximity to Lidar points: encouraging avoidance of obstacles
    obstacle_penalty = -np.min([l.fraction for l in self.lidar]) * 1.0
    
    # Total reward: a weighted sum with adjusted weights
    reward = (distance_reward
              + 0.3 * stability_penalty
              + 0.2 * action_penalty
              + 0.5 * obstacle_penalty)  # Higher weight given to distance reward and obstacle penalty
    
    individual_reward = {
        "distance_reward": distance_reward,
        "stability_penalty": stability_penalty,
        "action_penalty": action_penalty,
        "obstacle_penalty": obstacle_penalty
    }
    
    return reward, individual_reward
```
This new reward function should better align with the desired behavior and improve the performance of the agent.
