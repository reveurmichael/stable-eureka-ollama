Based on the feedback provided, I will analyze each existing reward component and propose a new reward function.

1. **Distance-based reward**: The values are relatively small, which might not provide enough motivation for the agent to move towards the goal. Suggest scaling up this reward.
2. **Stability reward**: The penalty values are quite high, which may discourage the agent from exploring certain actions. Consider reducing their magnitude or re-weighting them in the total reward calculation.
3. **Smoothness reward**: This penalty is also relatively high and might be discouraging the agent's natural exploration behavior. Suggest scaling down this penalty or adjusting its weight in the total reward calculation.
4. **Obstacle penalty**: The values are quite large, which suggests that avoiding obstacles is crucial for success. Keep this component as it is, but consider re-scaling the individual obstacle penalties to have a more gradual effect on the agent's behavior.

Considering the tips for analyzing feedback:

1. Since some components' values are nearly identical, I will scale them up or down to provide more contrast.
2. The **fitness score** should be maximized during training. To achieve this, I will make the total reward function more aligned with the fitness score.
3. As a general principle, I want to maximize positive reward components and minimize negative ones.

Based on these observations, here is my proposal for an improved reward function:

```python
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    # Distance-based reward: incentivizing movement to the right (scaled)
    distance_reward = pos.x / 500.0
    
    # Stability reward: penalizing large angle and angular velocity (reduced magnitude)
    angle_penalty = -np.abs(state[0]) * 0.001
    angular_velocity_penalty = -np.abs(state[1]) * 0.0005
    
    # Smoothness reward: penalizing high-speed actions (scaled)
    action_penalty = -np.sum(np.abs(action)) / len(action) * 0.02
    
    # Proximity to Lidar points: encouraging avoidance of obstacles
    obstacle_penalty = -np.min([l.fraction for l in self.lidar]) * 1.5
    
    # Fitness score reward: aligning the total reward with the fitness score
    fitness_reward = np.exp(-(fitness_score / 1000.0))
    
    # Total reward: a weighted sum with adjusted weights
    reward = (distance_reward
              + 0.2 * angle_penalty
              + 0.1 * angular_velocity_penalty
              + 0.05 * action_penalty
              + 0.7 * obstacle_penalty
              + fitness_reward)  # Higher weight given to distance reward and obstacle penalty
    
    individual_reward = {
        "distance_reward": distance_reward,
        "angle_penalty": angle_penalty,
        "angular_velocity_penalty": angular_velocity_penalty,
        "action_penalty": action_penalty,
        "obstacle_penalty": obstacle_penalty,
        "fitness_reward": fitness_reward
    }
    
    return reward, individual_reward
```

This new reward function aims to better align with the desired behavior and provide a more balanced incentive structure. The distance-based reward has been scaled up, while the stability and smoothness penalties have been reduced in magnitude. The obstacle penalty remains relatively high to encourage avoidance of obstacles. The fitness score reward is introduced to directly incentivize maximizing the ground truth evaluator.
