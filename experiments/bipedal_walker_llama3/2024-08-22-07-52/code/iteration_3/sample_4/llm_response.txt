After analyzing the provided policy feedback, I will propose an improved reward function. Here's my analysis:

1. **Obstacle penalty**: The magnitude of this component is significantly larger than others. I will re-scale it to ensure it has a similar impact as other components.
2. **Fitness score**: Since we want to maximize the fitness score (ground truth evaluator), I will set its weight in the reward function to 0.8, making it more prominent.
3. **Reward magnitude**: The values of the existing reward components are relatively small compared to the obstacle penalty. To balance them out, I'll scale up the positive reward components (distance_reward, angle_penalty, angular_velocity_penalty, action_penalty) by a factor of 10.

Here's the proposed improved reward function:
```python
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    # Distance-based reward: incentivizing movement to the right (scaled)
    distance_reward = pos.x / 200.0 * 10
    
    # Stability reward: penalizing large angle and angular velocity (reduced magnitude)
    angle_penalty = -np.abs(state[0]) * 0.001
    angular_velocity_penalty = -np.abs(state[1]) * 0.0005
    
    # Smoothness reward: penalizing high-speed actions (scaled)
    action_penalty = -np.sum(np.abs(action)) / len(action) * 0.05
    
    # Proximity to Lidar points: encouraging avoidance of obstacles
    obstacle_penalty = -np.min([l.fraction for l in self.lidar]) * 0.1
    
    # Total reward: a weighted sum with adjusted weights
    reward = (distance_reward * 0.2
              + angle_penalty * 0.05
              + angular_velocity_penalty * 0.05
              + action_penalty * 0.05
              + obstacle_penalty * 0.8)
    
    individual_reward = {
        "distance_reward": distance_reward,
        "angle_penalty": angle_penalty,
        "angular_velocity_penalty": angular_velocity_penalty,
        "action_penalty": action_penalty,
        "obstacle_penalty": obstacle_penalty
    }
    
    return reward, individual_reward
```
This revised reward function aims to strike a better balance between the components and prioritize maximizing the fitness score.
