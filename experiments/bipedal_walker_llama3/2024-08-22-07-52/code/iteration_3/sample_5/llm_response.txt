A challenging task!

After analyzing the policy feedback, I have identified some issues with the existing reward function. Here are my findings:

1. **Obstacle penalty**: The values of this component are quite large and scattered. This suggests that the agent is not consistently avoiding obstacles or is not being incentivized to do so.
2. **Fitness score**: Although we want to maximize the fitness score, its magnitude is much larger than the other reward components. This could be overwhelming the other rewards and causing the agent to focus solely on maximizing the fitness score.
3. **Reward**: The mean value of this component is negative, indicating that the agent is being penalized overall. However, there are some positive values, suggesting that the agent should be incentivized in certain situations.

Based on these findings, I propose a new reward function that addresses these issues:

```
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    # Distance-based reward: incentivizing movement to the right (scaled)
    distance_reward = pos.x / 200.0

    # Smoothness reward: penalizing high-speed actions (scaled)
    action_penalty = -np.sum(np.abs(action)) / len(action) * 0.05

    # Obstacle avoidance reward: encouraging avoidance of obstacles
    obstacle_avoidance = -np.min([l.fraction for l in self.lidar]) * 0.1

    # Proximity to goal reward: incentivizing proximity to the goal
    fitness_score_reward = np.exp(-(state[2] / 10.0))  # exponential decay with distance to goal

    # Total reward: a weighted sum with adjusted weights
    reward = (distance_reward * 0.3 + action_penalty * 0.15 +
              obstacle_avoidance * 0.2 + fitness_score_reward * 0.35)

    individual_reward = {
        "distance_reward": distance_reward,
        "action_penalty": action_penalty,
        "obstacle_avoidance": obstacle_avoidance,
        "fitness_score_reward": fitness_score_reward
    }

    return reward, individual_reward
```

Here's what I've changed:

1. **Obstacle penalty**: Replaced with a new component that incentivizes avoidance of obstacles.
2. **Fitness score**: Instead of trying to maximize the fitness score directly, we're using an exponential decay function to encourage the agent to move closer to the goal while avoiding obstacles.
3. **Reward**: Adjusted the weights and scales to balance the different components.

This revised reward function should better incentivize the agent to navigate through the environment, avoid obstacles, and move towards the goal.
