Based on the provided policy feedback, I'll analyze each existing reward component and propose a new reward function.

1. **Obstacle Penalty**: The values in this component are quite large (-9.345 to -4.641), indicating that avoiding obstacles is crucial for the task. However, since we want to maximize fitness score (ground truth evaluator), it's essential to scale this penalty to be comparable to other components.
2. **Fitness Score**: We want to maximize this component, which indicates that our ultimate goal is to optimize the agent's performance according to the fitness score.
3. **Reward**: The values in this component are relatively small (-4.536 to -2.212), suggesting that we should emphasize larger positive rewards during training.

Based on these insights, I'll propose a new reward function:

```python
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    # Distance-based reward: incentivizing movement to the right (scaled)
    distance_reward = pos.x / 200.0
    
    # Fitness score-based reward: maximizing fitness as much as possible
    fitness_reward = self.fitness_score * 10.0
    
    # Obstacle penalty: scaled and weighted to balance with other components
    obstacle_penalty = -np.min([l.fraction for l in self.lidar]) * 2.5
    
    # Smoothness reward: penalizing high-speed actions (scaled)
    action_penalty = -np.sum(np.abs(action)) / len(action) * 0.1
    
    # Total reward: a weighted sum with adjusted weights
    reward = (distance_reward + 0.3 * fitness_reward + 0.4 * obstacle_penalty - 0.2 * action_penalty)
    
    individual_reward = {
        "distance_reward": distance_reward,
        "fitness_reward": fitness_reward,
        "obstacle_penalty": obstacle_penalty,
        "action_penalty": action_penalty
    }
    
    return reward, individual_reward
```

Changes:

* Scaled the obstacle penalty to be comparable to other components.
* Emphasized larger positive rewards by maximizing the fitness score-based component.
* Introduced a smoothness penalty (action_penalty) with a smaller weight to balance with other components.

This new reward function should better encourage the agent to optimize its performance according to the fitness score while maintaining a balance between distance-based rewards, obstacle avoidance, and action smoothness.
