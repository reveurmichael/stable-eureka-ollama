Based on the provided feedback, I'll analyze each existing reward component and suggest modifications to improve the policy.

1. **Distance-based reward**: The values seem reasonable, but considering the magnitude of other components, it's worth scaling this one down further. Let's reduce the scale factor from 200.0 to 100.0.
2. **Stability reward (angle penalty)**: The absolute value of the angle is being penalized. While this makes sense, the magnitude of this penalty seems high compared to others. Reducing it by a factor of 5 might be beneficial. New penalty: `-np.abs(state[0]) * 0.001`
3. **Stability reward (angular velocity penalty)**: Similarly, the absolute value of angular velocity is being penalized. Another 5-fold reduction might be necessary. New penalty: `-np.abs(state[1]) * 0.0002`
4. **Smoothness reward (action penalty)**: This component's magnitude seems reasonable.
5. **Obstacle avoidance reward**: The values are relatively consistent, but the minimum distance to Lidar points is being used as a penalty. Considering this is an obstacle avoidance task, we want agents to move away from obstacles, so let's flip the sign and use the maximum distance instead: `np.max([l.fraction for l in self.lidar]) * 0.5`
6. **Fitness score reward**: Since the fitness score is the ground truth evaluator, we can directly use it as a reward component.

Here's the proposed new reward function:
```python
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    # Distance-based reward: incentivizing movement to the right (scaled)
    distance_reward = pos.x / 100.0
    
    # Stability reward: penalizing large angle and angular velocity (reduced magnitude)
    angle_penalty = -np.abs(state[0]) * 0.001
    angular_velocity_penalty = -np.abs(state[1]) * 0.0002
    
    # Smoothness reward: penalizing high-speed actions (scaled)
    action_penalty = -np.sum(np.abs(action)) / len(action) * 0.05
    
    # Proximity to Lidar points: encouraging avoidance of obstacles
    obstacle_reward = np.max([l.fraction for l in self.lidar]) * 0.5
    
    # Fitness score reward: maximizing the fitness score
    fitness_reward = -np.mean(fitness_score)
    
    # Total reward: a weighted sum with adjusted weights
    reward = (distance_reward
              + 0.1 * angle_penalty
              + 0.05 * angular_velocity_penalty
              + 0.2 * action_penalty
              + 0.3 * obstacle_reward
              + 0.5 * fitness_reward)
    
    individual_reward = {
        "distance_reward": distance_reward,
        "angle_penalty": angle_penalty,
        "angular_velocity_penalty": angular_velocity_penalty,
        "action_penalty": action_penalty,
        "obstacle_reward": obstacle_reward,
        "fitness_reward": fitness_reward
    }
    
    return reward, individual_reward
```
The new reward function aims to strike a balance between the different components while emphasizing the importance of maximizing the fitness score.
