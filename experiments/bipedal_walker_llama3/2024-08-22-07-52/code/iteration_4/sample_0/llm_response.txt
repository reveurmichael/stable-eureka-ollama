Based on the provided feedback, I will analyze each existing reward component and propose an improved reward function.

**Analysis of Existing Reward Components**

1. **Reward**: The values in this component are relatively high, indicating that the current policy is already performing well. However, there is some variation in the values, suggesting that there may be opportunities to improve the policy.
2. **Obstacle Penalty**: The mean value of this component is very low (-34.472...), indicating that the policy is not doing a good job of avoiding obstacles. This suggests that incorporating more negative reward for obstacle proximity could help improve the policy's performance.
3. **Fitness Score**: The values in this component are generally low, indicating that the current policy is not maximizing the fitness score. This suggests that the goal should be to maximize the fitness score.

**Proposed Improved Reward Function**

Based on the analysis above, I propose the following improved reward function:
```python
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    # Distance-based reward: incentivizing movement to the right (scaled)
    distance_reward = pos.x / 200.0 * 10
    
    # Stability reward: penalizing large angle and angular velocity (reduced magnitude)
    angle_penalty = -np.abs(state[0]) * 0.002
    angular_velocity_penalty = -np.abs(state[1]) * 0.0015
    
    # Smoothness reward: penalizing high-speed actions (scaled)
    action_penalty = -np.sum(np.abs(action)) / len(action) * 0.02
    
    # Obstacle penalty: increasing negative reward for obstacle proximity
    obstacle_penalty = -np.min([l.fraction for l in self.lidar]) * 0.5
    
    # Fitness score reward: incentivizing maximizing the fitness score
    fitness_reward = np.exp(self.fitness_score / 100.0) * 10
    
    # Total reward: a weighted sum with adjusted weights
    reward = (distance_reward * 0.2
              + angle_penalty * 0.05
              + angular_velocity_penalty * 0.05
              + action_penalty * 0.02
              + obstacle_penalty * 0.3
              + fitness_reward * 0.4)
    
    individual_rewards = {
        "distance_reward": distance_reward,
        "angle_penalty": angle_penalty,
        "angular_velocity_penalty": angular_velocity_penalty,
        "action_penalty": action_penalty,
        "obstacle_penalty": obstacle_penalty,
        "fitness_reward": fitness_reward
    }
    
    return reward, individual_rewards
```
The main changes are:

* Increased the magnitude of the obstacle penalty to encourage better obstacle avoidance.
* Introduced a new fitness score reward component that incentivizes maximizing the fitness score. This is done by exponentiating the fitness score and scaling it by a factor of 10.
* Adjusted the weights in the total reward calculation to reflect the relative importance of each component.

These changes aim to improve the policy's performance by providing more negative feedback for obstacles and encouraging better fitness scores.
