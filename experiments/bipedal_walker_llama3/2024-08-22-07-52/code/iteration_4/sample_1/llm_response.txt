Analyzing the existing reward components:

1. **fitness_score**: This component's values are significantly higher than the others. Since we want to maximize the fitness score, this component should dominate the overall reward.

2. **reward**: The values of this component range from 26.24 to 48.75, which is relatively high compared to the other components. Since we want to maximize positive reward components, this component's magnitude seems reasonable.

3. **obstacle_penalty**: This component's values are mostly around -35, which indicates a strong penalty for encountering obstacles. However, its mean value is lower than the overall reward, suggesting that avoiding obstacles should be a secondary goal.

4. **episode_length**: The episode lengths are all 1600, indicating that the agent doesn't learn to terminate episodes efficiently. This component is not relevant for shaping the policy, so it can be discarded.

Based on this analysis, I propose the following improved reward function:

```
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    # Fitness score: maximize fitness as ground truth evaluator
    fitness_reward = np.mean(fitness_score) * 10.0
    
    # Reward: incentivize movement and avoid obstacles
    distance_reward = pos.x / 200.0 * 2.0
    obstacle_penalty = -np.min([l.fraction for l in self.lidar]) * 0.5
    
    # Total reward: a weighted sum with adjusted weights
    reward = (fitness_reward * 0.8
              + distance_reward * 0.1
              + obstacle_penalty * 0.1)
    
    individual_reward = {
        "fitness_reward": fitness_reward,
        "distance_reward": distance_reward,
        "obstacle_penalty": obstacle_penalty
    }
    
    return reward, individual_reward
```

Changes made:

* The **fitness_score** component dominates the overall reward, incentivizing the agent to maximize the fitness score.
* The **reward** component has been simplified and its magnitude reduced to avoid overwhelming the other components.
* The **obstacle_penalty** component remains strong to encourage obstacle avoidance, but its magnitude is reduced to balance with the **distance_reward**.

This revised reward function should guide the agent towards maximizing the fitness score while maintaining a reasonable trade-off between movement and obstacle avoidance.
