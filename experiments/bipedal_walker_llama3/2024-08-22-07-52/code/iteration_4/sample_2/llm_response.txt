Based on the provided policy feedback, I will analyze each existing reward component and propose an improved reward function.

**Obstacle Penalty:** The values of this penalty are relatively consistent, with a mean value of -34.472331384345864. This suggests that the current obstacle avoidance strategy is effective, but may not be aggressive enough in some situations.

**Fitness Score:** As the ground truth evaluator, I want to maximize the fitness score during training. However, the values are quite low, which indicates that the current reward function may not be encouraging exploration or optimal behavior.

**Reward:** The maximum value of this component is 48.74730386864394, indicating that there are situations where the agent receives a significant positive reward. This suggests that the current reward function is incentivizing the right behavior, but may need adjustments to better align with the fitness score.

**Episode Length:** The episode length values are all the same (1600.0), which indicates that the agent is not exploring different strategies or encountering obstacles.

Based on these observations, I propose an improved reward function:

```
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    # Distance-based reward: incentivizing movement to the right (scaled)
    distance_reward = pos.x / 200.0 * 10
    
    # Stability reward: penalizing large angle and angular velocity (reduced magnitude)
    angle_penalty = -np.abs(state[0]) * 0.001
    angular_velocity_penalty = -np.abs(state[1]) * 0.0005
    
    # Smoothness reward: penalizing high-speed actions (scaled)
    action_penalty = -np.sum(np.abs(action)) / len(action) * 0.05
    
    # Obstacle avoidance reward: increasing with proximity to obstacles
    obstacle_reward = np.max([l.fraction for l in self.lidar]) * 0.2
    
    # Fitness-based reward: incentivizing high fitness scores
    fitness_reward = -np.abs(fitness_score) * 0.1
    
    # Total reward: a weighted sum with adjusted weights
    reward = (distance_reward * 0.3
              + angle_penalty * 0.05
              + angular_velocity_penalty * 0.05
              + action_penalty * 0.05
              + obstacle_reward * 0.2
              + fitness_reward * 0.4)
    
    individual_reward = {
        "distance_reward": distance_reward,
        "angle_penalty": angle_penalty,
        "angular_velocity_penalty": angular_velocity_penalty,
        "action_penalty": action_penalty,
        "obstacle_reward": obstacle_reward,
        "fitness_reward": fitness_reward
    }
    
    return reward, individual_reward
```

The main changes are:

* Increased the weight of the fitness-based reward to incentivize exploration and optimal behavior.
* Introduced an obstacle avoidance reward that increases with proximity to obstacles, to encourage more aggressive avoidance.
* Reduced the magnitude of the stability and smoothness penalties to focus more on the overall fitness score.

These adjustments aim to better align the reward function with the desired behavior and improve the agent's performance.
