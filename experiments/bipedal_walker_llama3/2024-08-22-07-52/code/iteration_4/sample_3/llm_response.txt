Based on the provided feedback, I will analyze each existing reward component and then write a new reward function code proposal.

**Analysis**

1. **Obstacle Penalty**: The values are mostly negative and have similar magnitudes. This suggests that the penalty should be reduced to encourage more exploration.
2. **Fitness Score**: The values are highly variable and mostly negative, which is undesirable. Ideally, we want to maximize the fitness score.
3. **Reward**: The values are mostly positive, indicating that the reward function is incentivizing desired behaviors. However, the mean value is relatively low, suggesting that the reward could be increased.
4. **Episode Length**: The episode length is fixed at 1600, which may not provide a strong signal for the agent to learn.

**New Reward Function Proposal**

Based on the analysis, I propose the following new reward function:
```python
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    # Distance-based reward: incentivizing movement to the right (scaled)
    distance_reward = pos.x / 200.0 * 10
    
    # Stability reward: penalizing large angle and angular velocity (reduced magnitude)
    angle_penalty = -np.abs(state[0]) * 0.005
    angular_velocity_penalty = -np.abs(state[1]) * 0.0025
    
    # Smoothness reward: penalizing high-speed actions (scaled)
    action_penalty = -np.sum(np.abs(action)) / len(action) * 0.02
    
    # Proximity to Lidar points: encouraging avoidance of obstacles
    obstacle_reward = -np.min([l.fraction for l in self.lidar]) * 0.05
    
    # Fitness score reward: incentivizing high fitness scores
    fitness_reward = np.clip(state[2], 0, 1) * 10
    
    # Total reward: a weighted sum with adjusted weights
    reward = (distance_reward * 0.3
              + angle_penalty * 0.05
              + angular_velocity_penalty * 0.05
              + action_penalty * 0.05
              + obstacle_reward * 0.1
              + fitness_reward * 0.2)
    
    individual_reward = {
        "distance_reward": distance_reward,
        "angle_penalty": angle_penalty,
        "angular_velocity_penalty": angular_velocity_penalty,
        "action_penalty": action_penalty,
        "obstacle_reward": obstacle_reward,
        "fitness_reward": fitness_reward
    }
    
    return reward, individual_reward
```
**Changes**

1. Reduced the magnitude of the obstacle penalty to encourage more exploration.
2. Introduced a fitness score reward component to incentivize high fitness scores.
3. Adjusted the weights of the different components to prioritize distance-based rewards and fitness scores.
4. Kept the stability and smoothness penalties to maintain some control over the agent's behavior.

This new reward function should better align with the desired behaviors and provide a more effective signal for the agent to learn from.
