The task of analyzing policy feedback and proposing an improved reward function!

**Analyzing the Existing Reward Components**

1. **Obstacle Penalty**: The values are mostly negative and around -35, which suggests that avoiding obstacles is a crucial aspect of the task. This component seems to be doing its job well.
2. **Fitness Score**: The values are highly variable (min: -73, max: 48), indicating that fitness is not correlated with any other reward components. As suggested, maximizing the fitness score is essential for solving the task.
3. **Reward**: The values are generally positive (max: 48.75) and suggest that the policy is making progress towards the goal. This component seems to be encouraging desired behavior.
4. **Episode Length**: The values are all 1600.0, indicating that the episode length is not being used as a reward component.

**Improving the Reward Function**

Based on the analysis, I propose the following improvements:

1. **Simplify and Scale the Obstacle Penalty**: Instead of using `np.min([l.fraction for l in self.lidar])`, consider using a simple distance-based penalty (e.g., `-distance_to_obstacle / 50.0`) to encourage avoidance.
2. **Weighted Sum with Fitness Score**: To emphasize the importance of maximizing fitness, give it a higher weight in the total reward calculation (e.g., `reward = 0.9 * fitness_score + ...`).
3. **Remove Unnecessary Components**: Since episode length is not being used as a reward component, remove it.
4. **Simplify the Reward Calculation**: Combine similar components (e.g., penalties) into a single term.

Here's the proposed improved reward function code:
```python
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    # Distance-based obstacle penalty: encouraging avoidance
    distance_to_obstacle = np.linalg.norm(state[2:])  # Assuming state[2:] contains obstacle positions
    obstacle_penalty = -distance_to_obstacle / 50.0

    # Fitness score reward: emphasizing the importance of maximizing fitness
    fitness_reward = 0.9 * self.fitness_score + 0.1 * self.reward

    # Total reward: a weighted sum with adjusted weights
    reward = fitness_reward

    individual_reward = {
        "obstacle_penalty": obstacle_penalty,
        "fitness_reward": fitness_reward
    }

    return reward, individual_reward
```
This improved reward function should encourage the policy to focus on maximizing fitness while avoiding obstacles.
