A challenging task! Let's dive into the analysis of each reward component.

1. **Distance-based reward**: The values are quite large (up to 10). This might be an issue since the goal is to maximize the fitness score. I'll scale this down by a factor of 0.01.
2. **Stability reward** (angle and angular velocity penalties): These penalties have similar magnitude, which could lead to issues during training. To mitigate this, I'll reduce their scales by a factor of 10 and combine them into a single stability penalty.
3. **Smoothness reward** (action penalty): The values are quite large (up to 0.05). This might be an issue since the goal is to maximize the fitness score. I'll scale this down by a factor of 0.01.
4. **Obstacle penalty**: These values are consistently low (around -35), which could lead to issues during training. To make the obstacle avoidance more important, I'll increase the scale by a factor of 10.

Now, let's create the new reward function code proposal:
```python
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    # Distance-based reward: incentivizing movement to the right (scaled)
    distance_reward = pos.x / 2000.0 * 0.01
    
    # Stability penalty: penalizing large angle and angular velocity
    stability_penalty = -np.abs(state[0]) * 0.001 - np.abs(state[1]) * 0.0005
    
    # Smoothness reward: penalizing high-speed actions (scaled)
    action_penalty = -np.sum(np.abs(action)) / len(action) * 0.01
    
    # Proximity to Lidar points: encouraging avoidance of obstacles
    obstacle_penalty = -np.min([l.fraction for l in self.lidar]) * 10
    
    # Total reward: a weighted sum with adjusted weights
    reward = (distance_reward * 0.1
              + stability_penalty * 0.2
              + action_penalty * 0.1
              + obstacle_penalty * 0.6)
    
    individual_reward = {
        "distance_reward": distance_reward,
        "stability_penalty": stability_penalty,
        "action_penalty": action_penalty,
        "obstacle_penalty": obstacle_penalty
    }
    
    return reward, individual_reward
```
The new reward function aims to:

* Incentivize movement to the right while reducing its importance (distance-based reward)
* Encourage stability and penalize large angles and angular velocities (stability penalty)
* Penalize high-speed actions while maintaining a balance between them (smoothness reward)
* Increase the importance of avoiding obstacles (obstacle penalty)

By adjusting the weights and scales, I hope to improve the policy feedback and guide the agent towards better solutions.
