Based on the provided feedback, I will analyze each component and provide a new reward function proposal.

1. **fitness_score**: The magnitude of this component is significantly larger than others. It should be re-scaled to have a similar magnitude as other components.
2. **reward**: The values in this component are positive, which indicates that the agent is encouraged to take certain actions. However, the range of values is quite large, suggesting that some actions may be over-rewarded. A possible solution is to normalize or cap the values to prevent over-rewarding.
3. **obstacle_penalty**: The magnitude of this component is also significantly larger than others. It should be re-scaled to have a similar magnitude as other components.

Considering these observations, I will propose a new reward function:

```python
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    # Distance-based reward: incentivizing movement to the right (scaled)
    distance_reward = pos.x / 200.0 * 1
    
    # Fitness score: re-scaled and weighted
    fitness_score_reduced = (fitness_score - np.mean(fitness_score)) / np.std(fitness_score) * 5
    
    # Smoothness reward: penalizing high-speed actions (scaled)
    action_penalty = -np.sum(np.abs(action)) / len(action) * 0.01
    
    # Proximity to Lidar points: encouraging avoidance of obstacles
    obstacle_penalty = -np.min([l.fraction for l in self.lidar]) * 0.05
    
    # Total reward: a weighted sum with adjusted weights
    reward = (distance_reward * 0.2
              + fitness_score_reduced * 0.3
              + action_penalty * 0.1
              + obstacle_penalty * 0.4)
    
    individual_reward = {
        "distance_reward": distance_reward,
        "fitness_score_reduced": fitness_score_reduced,
        "action_penalty": action_penalty,
        "obstacle_penalty": obstacle_penalty
    }
    
    return reward, individual_reward
```

This new reward function aims to:

1. Reduce the magnitude of the fitness score by re-scaling it.
2. Encourage movement to the right while keeping the distance reward component's magnitude consistent with other components.
3. Adjust the weights of each component to balance their contributions to the total reward.

Please note that this proposal is just a starting point, and further tuning may be necessary based on the performance of your reinforcement learning model.
