Based on the provided feedback and tips for analyzing policy feedback, I will analyze each existing reward component and propose a new reward function.

1. **reward**: This is the ground truth evaluator and should be maximized during training. Its values are relatively high, indicating that the task is being solved correctly.

2. **obstacle_penalty**: The minimum value of -39.421372249721536 suggests that avoiding obstacles is crucial for successful navigation. This component seems to have a significant impact on the overall reward.

3. **fitness_score**: Since fitness score is the ground truth evaluator, it's essential to maximize it during training. However, its values are relatively low, indicating that the task might be difficult or there may be some issues with the environment or policy.

4. **episode_length**: This component seems irrelevant for the reward function as it only measures the duration of each episode.

To improve the reward function, I will focus on maximizing the fitness score and avoiding obstacles while minimizing the negative components (distance_reward, angle_penalty, angular_velocity_penalty, action_penalty). Here's a proposed new reward function code:

```Python
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    # Distance-based penalty: discourage movement away from target
    distance_penalty = -np.min([l.fraction for l in self.lidar]) * 0.1
    
    # Stability reward: penalize large angle and angular velocity (reduced magnitude)
    angle_stability = -np.abs(state[0]) * 0.001
    angular_velocity_stability = -np.abs(state[1]) * 0.0005
    
    # Smoothness reward: penalize high-speed actions (scaled)
    action_smoothness = -np.sum(np.abs(action)) / len(action) * 0.05
    
    # Obstacle penalty: encourage avoidance of obstacles
    obstacle_penalty = -np.min([l.fraction for l in self.lidar]) * 0.1
    
    # Fitness score-based reward: maximize fitness score (scaled)
    fitness_reward = np.mean(self.fitness_score) * 0.5
    
    # Total reward: a weighted sum with adjusted weights
    reward = (fitness_reward - distance_penalty
              + angle_stability
              + angular_velocity_stability
              + action_smoothness
              - obstacle_penalty)
    
    individual_reward = {
        "distance_penalty": distance_penalty,
        "angle_stability": angle_stability,
        "angular_velocity_stability": angular_velocity_stability,
        "action_smoothness": action_smoothness,
        "obstacle_penalty": obstacle_penalty,
        "fitness_reward": fitness_reward
    }
    
    return reward, individual_reward
```

This new reward function prioritizes maximizing the fitness score while encouraging smooth movements and avoiding obstacles. The distance-based penalty discourages movement away from the target, which should help improve navigation.
