Here's an example of a simple penalty function using Python:
```python
import numpy as np

def compute_repayment(distance颁奖_距离), angle_penalty(angle颁奖_角度)), obstacle_penalty(obstacle颁奖_角度)))

rewards = compute_repayment(0.1), 5.0, 9.0)

individual_rewards = compute_repayment(0.1), 5.0, [10.0 for _ in range(3)]])

print("Original Reward:")
print(rewards[0]])

print("\nIndividual Reward:")
for index, reward in enumerate(individual_rewards)):
    print(f"{index+1}}. Reward: {reward}")
```
This code defines a simple penalty function that calculates the reward based on the distance颁奖_距离 and angle颁奖_角度 between the camera and the ground. The individual rewards are calculated by summing up 3 elements for each individual reward.
You can modify this code to suit your specific needs, such as changing the distance颁奖_距离 and angle颁奖_角度 values, or adding more individual rewards elements.
It's also essential to consider the implementation details of your penalty function, such as how you calculate the distance颁奖_distance and angle颁奖_angle values, or how you add individual reward elements to your penalty function.
