Here's an example of a reward function in Python using the previous coding tips:
```python
def compute_reward(pos, action, state), individual_reward:
    distance_earned = pos.ox - ACTION_0_ + (ACTION_1_ != None ? ACTION_1_ : 0) * (state[0]) - ACTION_0_))
    angle_earned = math.atan2(pos.y - state[0][1]]) - ACTION_0_)
    
    if distance_earned < 0 or distance_earned > 10:
        individual_reward += 10
    elif distance_earned < 5 or distance_earned > 35:
        individual_reward += 5
    elif distance_earned < 2.5 or distance_earned > 15:
        individual_reward += 2.5
    elif distance_earned < 1 or distance_earned > 70:
        individual_reward += 1

reward, individual_reward = compute_reward(pos, action, state), individual_reward

if individual_reward > reward:
    print("Individual Reward is higher than the Reward")  # Example Output: Individual Reward is higher than the Reward
