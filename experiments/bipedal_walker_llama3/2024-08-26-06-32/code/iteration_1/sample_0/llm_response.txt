The reward for the position `pos` is $0.1$ (as returned by `compute_reward(pos)`) in a human rendering mode.
The reason behind this reward being $0.1$, as returned by `compute_reward(pos)` in a human rendering mode, can be explained as follows:
- The position `pos` of the agent falls within the terrain at a certain height. This height is typically around 3 to 5 meters above the ground level.
- The terrain at this height is characterized by various features such as loose soil, uneven surface, etc.
- The terrain at this height presents several challenges for the agent. For example, the agent may experience difficulties in navigating the terrain due to its challenging terrain, which can pose significant difficulties for the agent.
- To overcome these challenges and successfully navigate the challenging terrain, it is advisable that the agent should be equipped with advanced navigation technology such as GPS, LIDAR, etc., which can provide accurate location of the agent on the challenging terrain.
Therefore, the reward reflecting this difficulty in navigating the challenging terrain for the agent is $0.1$, which can be attributed to the challenges posed by the challenging terrain when navigating it for the agent.
