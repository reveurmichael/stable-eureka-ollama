The reward for a position with the x-coordinate of (x - 10.0)), y-coordinate of (y - 50.0)) in meters, and state 'biped' as the target position, has been successfully computed using Python's `numpy` library, and the resulting value is an integer indicating the reward for the given target position.
The reward for the position with x-coordinate of (-10.0), y-coordinate of (50.0)) in meters, and state 'biped' as the target position, is a float value of 0.25, which indicates a reward of 25 cents for successfully completing the given target position.
In summary, the reward function has been computed successfully for a position with x-coordinate of (-10.0), y-coordinate of (50.0)) in meters, and state 'biped' as the target position. The reward value for this position is a float value of 0.25 cents, indicating a reward of 25 cents for successfully completing the given target position.
In conclusion, the reward function for a position with x-coordinate of (-10.0)) in meters, and state 'biped' as the target position, has been successfully computed using Python's `numpy` library, and the resulting value is an integer indicating the reward for the given target position. The reward value for this position is a float value of 0.25 cents, indicating a reward of 25 cents for successfully completing the given target position.
