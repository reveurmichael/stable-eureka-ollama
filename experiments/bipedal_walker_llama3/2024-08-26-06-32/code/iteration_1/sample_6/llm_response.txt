The reward reflection for the given reward code is:
- The value of `reward` in the `individual_reward` object has been successfully reflected in the `reward_reflection` object.
- The `reward_reflection` object has two properties: `reward` and `terminated`. 
- The `reward_reflection` object's `reward` property reflects the given reward code, which is 0.5. 
- The `reward_reflection` object's `terminated` property reflects that the reward for reaching certain terminal states (e.g., 100 steps) has been successfully reflected in the `reward_reflection` object.
Therefore, the reward reflection reflects the successful execution of the given reward code, which is 0.5.
