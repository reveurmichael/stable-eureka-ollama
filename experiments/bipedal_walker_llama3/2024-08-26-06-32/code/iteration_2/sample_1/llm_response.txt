Your reward reflects a smooth and consistent increase in the overall fitness score of the agent.
The rate at which your reward increases is determined by the parameters `t_max`, `min_reward`, and `max_reward` specified in your reward code. These parameters control the maximum value of your reward that can be achieved, while the minimum value of your reward remains constant at zero.
Your reward code specifies the following parameters:
- t_max: 10
- min_reward: 0.5
- max_reward: 20

These parameters determine how much time the agent spends working towards reaching its maximum reward, and how much time it spends working towards avoiding its minimum reward.
The value assigned to `min_reward` is set to zero in order to avoid any potential negative consequences that may arise as a result of the lower than zero, and prevent the agent from reaching its maximum reward for the same reason as well.
