The reward value of the given position (x,y) in a human environment with render mode set to "human" is:

```
[ 0.       ,    0.       ],
[ 0.       ,    0.       ],  
[ 0.       ,    0.       ],  
[ 0.       ,    0.       ],  
[ 0.       ,    0.       ],  
[ 0.       ,    0.       ],  
```

Note: The reward value in a human environment is dependent on various factors such as the distance from the position center, the terrain type, the weather conditions, and so on. In addition to these factors, render mode "human" also affects the reward value calculation based on the current rendered world state.
