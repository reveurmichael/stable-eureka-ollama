The reward you received for moving from a terrains with a step of `SPEED_HIP` to a terrains with the same length but having an additional step of `SPEED_KEE` to a terrains with a shorter length and having a third step of `SPEED_KKN` to a terrains with a smaller length and having a fourth step of `SPEED_HYP` to the end. The reward value for moving from terrains 1 with a step of `SPEED_HIP` to terrains 2 with a step of `SPEED_KEE`, where terrains 1 and 2 have the same length but have one additional step of `SPEED_KEE` to terrains 3 with a shorter length than terrains 1, 2, and 3. Having a third additional step of `SPEED_KEE` to terrains 4 with a smaller length than terrains 1, 2, and 3, has an additional step of `SPEED_KKN` to terrains 5 with a smaller length and having a fourth additional step of `SPEED_HYP` to the end.
