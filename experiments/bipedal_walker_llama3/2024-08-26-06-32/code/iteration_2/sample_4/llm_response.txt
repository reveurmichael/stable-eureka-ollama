Here's an example of how you might use this reward code function to track your individual rewards for completing various actions in a given environment during a specific time period:

```
# Reward code for tracking individual rewards
reward_code = "REWARD_01"

# Total reward earned
total_reward_earned = 25

# Number of reward earned
number_of_rewards_earned = 3

# Individual reward earned
individual_reward_earned = number_of_rewards_earned * total_reward_earned

# Average individual reward earned over time period (T)
average_individual_reward_earned_over_time_period_ = (
    individual_reward_earned_ / sum(individual_reward_earned_)) +
    average_reward_averaged_over_time_period_

# Total reward earned
total_reward_earned = sum(total_reward_earned_i))
