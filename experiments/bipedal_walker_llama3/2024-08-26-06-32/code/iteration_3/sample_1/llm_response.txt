The reward code you have specified is:

```
{
    'individual_reward': {
        'fitness_score': {
            }
        }

    'reward': {
        'individual_reward': 0.1,
        'fitness_score': 0.9,
        'reward': 0.2
    }
}
```

Reflection on the reward mechanism:

The reward mechanism in the given Python code appears to be a combination of individual reward and fitness score update.

Here are some key points about the reward mechanism:

- Individual reward: This component updates the individual reward of each action taken by the agent. This is achieved using the `fitness_score_update` method, which updates the fitness score with new values. The individual reward for an action `a` in this code is `individual_reward(a)`, where `individual_reward(a)` is a value that represents the reward for taking action `a`. For example, if we have an agent that performs actions such as `open Door`, then the individual reward for this action would be `individual_reward(open Door)`.

- Fitness score update: This component updates the fitness score with new values. This is achieved using the `fitness_score_update` method, which updates the fitness score with new values. The fitness score for an action `a` in this code is `fitness_score(a)`, where `fitness_score(a)` is a value that represents the fitness score of action `a`. For example, if we have an agent that performs actions such as `open Door`, then the fitness score for this action would be `0.8`, where `0.8` is a value that represents the fitness score of action `open Door`.

- Reward calculation: This component calculates the reward for taking a particular action by an agent in a given environment.

In summary, the reward mechanism in the Python code appears to update the individual reward and fitness score of actions taken by an agent in a given environment. These components work together to provide rewards to agents based on their actions in a given environment.
