Your reward reflects the progress made by the agent towards the goal. The reward function computes a scalar value that represents the progress of the agent in reaching the goal.
The reward function takes into account several factors that influence the agent's progress towards the goal. Some key factors that affect the agent's progress towards the goal are:
- Acceleration due to gravity (g): 9.81 m/s^2)
- Kinetic energy (KE): 0.01 J/K)
