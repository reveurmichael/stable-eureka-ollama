The reward value returned by the `compute_reward()` function with an index of [0] is as follows:
```python
reward_value = self.compute_reward([0], action, state)  # Example calculation
return reward_value
```

This indicates that the reward value returned by the `compute_reward()` function at index `[0]]` is equal to `self.compute_reward([0], action, state)])`, which confirms that the reward value returned by the `compute_reward()` function with an index of `[0]]` is indeed equal to `self.compute_reward([0], action, state)])`.
