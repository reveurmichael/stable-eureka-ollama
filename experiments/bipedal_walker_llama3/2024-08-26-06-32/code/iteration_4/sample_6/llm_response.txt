The reward code you provided is 1.0. This indicates that the agent has successfully completed the given task by reaching its goal. 
The reward reflects the success of the agent in completing the task. The reward is calculated based on the success of the agent in reaching its goal, and the resulting reward is used to evaluate the performance of the agent.
In this scenario, the agent has successfully completed the task by reaching its goal. Therefore, the reward for the agent's successful completion of the task would be equal to the distance traveled by the agent from its starting position. In other words, the reward should reflect the total distance traveled by the agent in completing the task, rather than just the individual distance traveled for each step taken.
In conclusion, the reward function that reflects the success of an agent in completing a given task would involve taking into account not only the distance traveled by the agent from its starting position but also the number of steps taken by the agent in completing the task. The reward function should take into account the total distance traveled by the agent in completing the task, as well as the number of steps taken by the agent in completing the task.
