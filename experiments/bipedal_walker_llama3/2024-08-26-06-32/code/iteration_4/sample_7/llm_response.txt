The reward provided by the state function is:

```
reward = [SPEED_HIP for _ in range(self.legs[0].maxSpeedIndex])) + 0.1
```


 Reward calculation: 
- The `SPEED_HIP` variable represents the maximum speed of the biped system.
- The value `[self.legs[0].maxSpeedIndex]]` indicates that the maximum speed of the left leg is set to `[self.legs[0].maxSpeedIndex]]`.
- The reward `reward = [SPEED_HIP for _ in range(self.legs[0].maxSpeedIndex])) + 0.1` represents the rewards provided by the state function for each leg of the biped system.
The total reward received from the environment is `total_reward = reward[0] * reward[1]]`, where `reward[0]], reward[1]]` represent the rewards received for each leg, respectively.
