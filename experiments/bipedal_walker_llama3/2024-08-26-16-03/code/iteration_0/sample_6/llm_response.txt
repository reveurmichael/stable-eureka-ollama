The provided code is a variation of the initial reward proposal. It keeps the same components (distance-based, stability, smoothness, and proximity to Lidar points) but adjusts the weights assigned to each component. In this version, the distance reward has been decreased in importance relative to obstacle avoidance and action penalty, which are now more heavily weighted. This change is intended to promote exploration of the environment while avoiding obstacles.
