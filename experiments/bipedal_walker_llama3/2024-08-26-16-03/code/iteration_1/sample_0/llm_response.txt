Based on the provided feedback, I will analyze each existing reward component and propose an improved reward function.

1. **Distance-based reward**: The values seem to be increasing as expected, but the magnitude is quite high (up to 0.5). This could be due to the exponential scaling. Considering the scale of the problem, it might be beneficial to reduce the magnitude by re-scaling or modifying the component.
2. **Stability reward**: The absolute value of state[0] and state[1] are used as penalties, which seems correct. However, the magnitude is relatively small (up to 0.5). This could be due to the tanh function. To make it more impactful, consider increasing the scaling factor or re-scaling the component.
3. **Smoothness reward**: The absolute value of action is used as a penalty, which seems correct. However, the magnitude is relatively small (up to 0.5). This could be due to the tanh function and the normalization by the length of the action vector. To make it more impactful, consider increasing the scaling factor or re-scaling the component.
4. **Proximity to Lidar points**: The values seem to be decreasing as expected, but the magnitude is quite high (up to 1). This could be due to the exponential scaling. Considering the scale of the problem, it might be beneficial to reduce the magnitude by re-scaling or modifying the component.

Analyzing the feedback score, I notice that the fitness score is not improving during training. This suggests that the current reward function might not be aligned with the desired behavior.

**Proposed improved reward function:**

To better solve the task, I propose a new reward function that incorporates the insights from the analysis:

```python
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    # Distance-based reward: incentivizing movement to the right (re-scaled)
    distance_reward = 0.2 * np.tanh(pos.x / 200.0) - 1
    
    # Stability reward: penalizing large angle and angular velocity (re-scaled)
    angle_penalty = -np.abs(state[0]) * 0.8
    angle_penalty = np.tanh(angle_penalty / 0.5)
    
    angular_velocity_penalty = -np.abs(state[1]) * 0.8
    angular_velocity_penalty = np.tanh(angular_velocity_penalty / 0.5)
    
    # Smoothness reward: penalizing high-speed actions (re-scaled)
    action_penalty = -np.sum(np.abs(action)) / len(action) * 0.3
    action_penalty = np.tanh(action_penalty / 0.2)
    
    # Proximity to Lidar points: encouraging avoidance of obstacles (re-scaled)
    obstacle_penalty = -np.min([l.fraction for l in self.lidar]) * 0.5
    obstacle_penalty = np.exp(obstacle_penalty)  # Exponential scaling for higher penalty
    
    # Total reward: a weighted sum with adjusted weights
    reward = (distance_reward
              + 0.05 * angle_penalty
              + 0.05 * angular_velocity_penalty
              + 0.1 * action_penalty
              + 0.5 * obstacle_penalty)  # Higher weight given to obstacle penalty and action penalty
    
    individual_reward = {
        "distance_reward": distance_reward,
        "angle_penalty": angle_penalty,
        "angular_velocity_penalty": angular_velocity_penalty,
        "action_penalty": action_penalty,
        "obstacle_penalty": obstacle_penalty,
    }
    
    return reward, individual_reward
```

In this proposed reward function:

* The distance-based reward is re-scaled to have a smaller magnitude (0.2) and uses the tanh function.
* The stability and smoothness rewards are re-scaled to have a larger magnitude (0.8 and 0.3 respectively).
* The proximity to Lidar points remains unchanged, as it seems to be aligned with the desired behavior.
* The total reward is updated with adjusted weights to prioritize obstacle avoidance and action penalty.

Please note that this is just a proposal, and further tuning might be necessary to achieve optimal performance.
