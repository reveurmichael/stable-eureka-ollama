Let's analyze the feedback and identify potential improvements to the reward function.

**Fitness score**: The fitness score is not improving during training. This suggests that the current reward function might be mismatched with the desired behavior.

**Reward components**:

1. **Distance-based reward**: The values are quite high, which may indicate that the policy is strongly incentivized to move towards the right. However, there's no clear relationship between this component and the fitness score.
2. **Stability reward**: The absolute values are relatively small, indicating a minor penalty for large angle and angular velocity. This might not be enough to encourage stability in the agent's behavior.
3. **Smoothness reward**: The values are also relatively small, suggesting that high-speed actions are not heavily penalized.
4. **Proximity to Lidar points**: The values are quite high, indicating a strong penalty for being close to obstacles. This might be over-penalizing the agent for minor mistakes.

Based on these observations, I propose an updated reward function:

```
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    # Distance-based reward: incentivizing movement to the right
    distance_reward = np.exp(pos.x / 200.0) - 1

    # Stability reward: penalizing large angle and angular velocity
    angle_penalty = -np.abs(state[0])
    angle_penalty = np.tanh(angle_penalty / 2)
    
    angular_velocity_penalty = -np.abs(state[1])
    angular_velocity_penalty = np.tanh(angular_velocity_penalty / 2)

    # Smoothness reward: penalizing high-speed actions
    action_penalty = -np.sum(np.abs(action)) / len(action)
    action_penalty = np.tanh(action_penalty / 0.5)

    # Proximity to Lidar points: encouraging avoidance of obstacles
    obstacle_penalty = -np.min([l.fraction for l in self.lidar])
    obstacle_penalty = np.exp(obstacle_penalty)  # Exponential scaling for higher penalty

    # Total reward: a weighted sum with adjusted weights
    reward = (distance_reward
              + 0.3 * angle_penalty
              + 0.2 * angular_velocity_penalty
              + 0.1 * action_penalty
              - 0.8 * obstacle_penalty)  # Higher weight given to stability and smoothness, lower weight to distance-based reward

    individual_reward = {
        "distance_reward": distance_reward,
        "angle_penalty": angle_penalty,
        "angular_velocity_penalty": angular_velocity_penalty,
        "action_penalty": action_penalty,
        "obstacle_penalty": obstacle_penalty,
    }

    return reward, individual_reward
```

**Changes:**

1. Reduced the temperature parameter for the distance-based reward to make it less dominant.
2. Increased the weights for stability and smoothness rewards to encourage more stable and controlled behavior.
3. Decreased the weight for the obstacle penalty to reduce over-penalization.

These changes aim to create a more balanced reward function that encourages the agent to move towards the right while maintaining stability, smoothness, and avoiding obstacles.
