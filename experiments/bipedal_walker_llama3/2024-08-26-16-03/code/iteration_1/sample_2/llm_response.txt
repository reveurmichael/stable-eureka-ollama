A challenging problem!

After analyzing the feedback, I've identified some issues with the existing reward function. Here's my proposal for an improved version:

**Key findings and recommendations:**

1. **Fitness score:** The fitness score is not improving during training, indicating that the current reward function may not be correctly guiding the policy.
2. **Reward components:** Some components have similar or identical values (e.g., `distance_reward` and `obstacle_penalty`), which might not provide sufficient contrast for the policy to learn from.
3. **Scaling:** The magnitude of some components is significantly larger than others, which may affect their relative importance in the reward calculation.

**New reward function proposal:**

Here's a modified version of the original code:
```python
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    # Distance-based reward: incentivizing movement to the right (scaled)
    distance_reward = np.tanh(pos.x / 200.0)  # Reduce scaling factor

    # Stability reward: penalizing large angle and angular velocity (simplified)
    stability_penalty = -np.abs(state[0] + state[1])  # Combine both components

    # Smoothness reward: penalizing high-speed actions (scaled)
    action_penalty = np.tanh(-np.sum(np.abs(action)) / len(action) * 2.0)

    # Proximity to Lidar points: encouraging avoidance of obstacles
    obstacle_penalty = -np.min([l.fraction for l in self.lidar])

    # Total reward: a weighted sum with adjusted weights
    reward = (distance_reward + 0.25 * stability_penalty + 0.5 * action_penalty + 0.75 * obstacle_penalty)

    individual_reward = {
        "distance_reward": distance_reward,
        "stability_penalty": stability_penalty,
        "action_penalty": action_penalty,
        "obstacle_penalty": obstacle_penalty,
    }

    return reward, individual_reward
```
**Changes:**

1. Reduced the scaling factor for `distance_reward` to make it more comparable to other components.
2. Combined the `angle_penalty` and `angular_velocity_penalty` into a single `stability_penalty`, as they are related concepts.
3. Scaled the `action_penalty` to make it more comparable to other components, and adjusted its weight in the total reward calculation.
4. Left the `obstacle_penalty` unchanged, as it seems to be providing a strong incentive for avoiding obstacles.

This new reward function should provide a better balance between exploration and exploitation, while encouraging the policy to avoid obstacles and maintain stability.
