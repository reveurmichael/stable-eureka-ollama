Based on the provided feedback and tips for analyzing policy feedback, I will analyze each existing reward component and propose an improved reward function.

**Analysis of Existing Reward Components**

1. **Distance-based reward**: The values are relatively high, but not extremely high. This suggests that the agent has learned to move towards the goal. However, the exponential scaling might not be optimal.
2. **Stability reward (angle and angular velocity penalties)**: The values are negative, which is correct since we want to minimize these aspects. However, the magnitude of these values is relatively small compared to others. This suggests that the agent has learned to maintain stability to some extent.
3. **Smoothness reward (action penalty)**: The values are negative and relatively high, indicating that the agent has learned to avoid high-speed actions. This is good, but we might want to adjust the weight or scale of this component.
4. **Proximity to Lidar points (obstacle penalty)**: The values are very low, suggesting that the agent is not effectively avoiding obstacles.

**Proposed Improved Reward Function**

Based on the analysis above, I propose an improved reward function:

```python
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    # Distance-based reward: incentivizing movement to the right
    distance_reward = np.log(1 + (state[0] / 400.0))  # Adjusted scale and logarithmic scaling
    
    # Stability reward: penalizing large angle and angular velocity
    angle_penalty = -np.abs(state[0])
    angle_penalty = np.tanh(angle_penalty / 0.5)
    
    angular_velocity_penalty = -np.abs(state[1])
    angular_velocity_penalty = np.tanh(angular_velocity_penalty / 0.5)
    
    # Smoothness reward: penalizing high-speed actions
    action_penalty = -np.sum(np.abs(action)) / len(action) * 0.2  # Adjusted scale and weight
    
    # Proximity to Lidar points: encouraging avoidance of obstacles
    obstacle_penalty = -np.min([l.fraction for l in self.lidar]) * 1.5  # Adjusted scale and weight
    
    # Total reward: a weighted sum with adjusted weights
    reward = (distance_reward
              + 0.2 * angle_penalty
              + 0.2 * angular_velocity_penalty
              + 0.4 * action_penalty
              + 0.8 * obstacle_penalty)  # Higher weight given to obstacle penalty and action penalty
    
    individual_reward = {
        "distance_reward": distance_reward,
        "angle_penalty": angle_penalty,
        "angular_velocity_penalty": angular_velocity_penalty,
        "action_penalty": action_penalty,
        "obstacle_penalty": obstacle_penalty,
    }
    
    return reward, individual_reward
```

**Changes Made**

1. Adjusted the scale and logarithmic scaling of the distance-based reward to encourage more movement towards the goal.
2. Increased the weight of the smoothness reward to discourage high-speed actions.
3. Increased the weight of the obstacle penalty to encourage avoidance of obstacles.

The proposed improved reward function should better guide the agent towards solving the task, as it now places a greater emphasis on avoiding obstacles and maintaining stability while moving towards the goal.
