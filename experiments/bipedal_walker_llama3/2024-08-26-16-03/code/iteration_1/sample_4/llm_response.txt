Based on the feedback, I will analyze each existing reward component and propose an improved reward function.

**Analyzing Feedback Components**

1. **Fitness Score**: The fitness score is the ground truth evaluator, so we want to maximize it. However, the values are mostly negative, which means our current policy is not performing well.
2. **Reward**: The reward values seem reasonable, but some components (e.g., distance_reward) have large magnitudes that might be overwhelming other components. We should consider scaling these components or re-writing them to better balance their contributions.

**Proposed Improved Reward Function**

Considering the feedback and the original Stable-Eureka code, I propose the following improved reward function:
```python
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    # Distance-based reward: incentivizing movement to the right
    distance_reward = np.tanh(pos.x / 100.0)  # Scale down magnitude

    # Stability reward: penalizing large angle and angular velocity
    angle_penalty = -np.abs(state[0])
    angle_penalty = np.exp(angle_penalty / 10.0)  # Exponential scaling for higher penalty

    angular_velocity_penalty = -np.abs(state[1])
    angular_velocity_penalty = np.exp(angular_velocity_penalty / 10.0)

    # Smoothness reward: penalizing high-speed actions
    action_penalty = -np.sum(np.abs(action)) / len(action)
    action_penalty = np.tanh(action_penalty / 5.0)  # Scale down magnitude

    # Proximity to Lidar points: encouraging avoidance of obstacles
    obstacle_penalty = -np.min([l.fraction for l in self.lidar])
    obstacle_penalty = np.exp(obstacle_penalty)  # Exponential scaling for higher penalty

    # Total reward: a weighted sum with adjusted weights
    reward = (0.4 * distance_reward + 0.2 * angle_penalty +
              0.1 * angular_velocity_penalty + 0.3 * action_penalty)

    individual_reward = {
        "distance_reward": distance_reward,
        "angle_penalty": angle_penalty,
        "angular_velocity_penalty": angular_velocity_penalty,
        "action_penalty": action_penalty,
        "obstacle_penalty": obstacle_penalty,
    }

    return reward, individual_reward
```
**Changes**

1. Scaled down the magnitude of the `distance_reward` component to make it more comparable with other components.
2. Increased the exponential scaling for the `angle_penalty` and `angular_velocity_penalty` components to emphasize their importance.
3. Reduced the magnitude of the `action_penalty` component to balance its contribution with other rewards.
4. Kept the same weights as before, but adjusted them slightly based on the feedback analysis.

This improved reward function should better guide our policy towards more effective behaviors.
