Based on the provided policy feedback, I will analyze each existing reward component and propose an improved reward function.

**Fitness Score Feedback**
The fitness score values are highly negative. This suggests that the current reward function is not encouraging good policies. To improve this, we need to change the reward function to provide more positive rewards for desirable behaviors.

**Reward Component Analysis**

1. **Distance-based Reward**: The values range from -25 to 634, indicating a large difference in scale. This component should be re-scaled or normalized.
2. **Stability Reward**: The values are highly negative and seem to be encouraging stability. However, the magnitude is large compared to other components. We can consider reducing its weight in the total reward calculation.
3. **Smoothness Reward**: These values are also highly negative and suggest that high-speed actions are being penalized. This component should be re-scaled or normalized.
4. **Proximity to Lidar Points**: The values are relatively small, indicating that this component is not significantly impacting the overall reward.

**Proposed Improved Reward Function**
To address the issues mentioned above, I propose the following improved reward function:

```python
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    # Distance-based reward: incentivizing movement to the right (normalized)
    distance_reward = np.tanh(pos.x / 400.0)  # Normalized between -1 and 1

    # Stability reward: penalizing large angle and angular velocity (reduced weight)
    angle_penalty = -np.abs(state[0])
    angle_penalty = np.tanh(angle_penalty / 2.0)  # Reduced magnitude

    angular_velocity_penalty = -np.abs(state[1])
    angular_velocity_penalty = np.tanh(angular_velocity_penalty / 2.0)  # Reduced magnitude

    # Smoothness reward: penalizing high-speed actions (normalized)
    action_penalty = -np.sum(np.abs(action)) / len(action)
    action_penalty = np.tanh(action_penalty / 2.0)  # Normalized between -1 and 1

    # Proximity to Lidar points: encouraging avoidance of obstacles
    obstacle_reward = np.min([l.fraction for l in self.lidar])
    obstacle_reward = np.exp(obstacle_reward)  # Exponential scaling for higher reward

    # Total reward: a weighted sum with adjusted weights
    reward = (distance_reward + 0.2 * angle_penalty + 0.1 * angular_velocity_penalty + 0.3 * action_penalty + 0.4 * obstacle_reward)

    individual_reward = {
        "distance_reward": distance_reward,
        "angle_penalty": angle_penalty,
        "angular_velocity_penalty": angular_velocity_penalty,
        "action_penalty": action_penalty,
        "obstacle_reward": obstacle_reward,
    }

    return reward, individual_reward
```

In this proposed improved reward function:

* The distance-based reward is normalized between -1 and 1.
* The stability and smoothness rewards have reduced magnitude to reduce their impact on the overall reward.
* The proximity to Lidar points reward has a higher weight to encourage avoidance of obstacles.
* The total reward is calculated as a weighted sum of these components.

This improved reward function should better align with the desired behaviors and provide more positive feedback for good policies.
