Based on the provided feedback, I will analyze each component and suggest improvements.

**Fitness Score**: The fitness score is a ground truth evaluator, and we want to maximize it. However, the values are negative, indicating that the current policy is not performing well. This suggests that the reward function should be revised to encourage better performance.

**Reward**: The reward values show a range of positive values, with some outliers. This could indicate that the current reward function is encouraging exploration and movement towards the right (distance-based reward). However, the large magnitude of the reward values could be problematic during training, as it may dominate other components. I suggest scaling or normalizing these values.

**Episode Length**: The episode length is constant across all episodes, indicating that the policy is not learning to terminate episodes efficiently.

Based on this analysis, I will modify the existing reward function to:

1. Encourage better performance by maximizing the fitness score.
2. Scale and normalize the reward values to prevent dominance during training.
3. Modify the stability, smoothness, and obstacle penalty components to adjust their weights or scales based on the feedback.

Here is the revised reward function code proposal:
```python
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    # Distance-based reward: incentivizing movement to the right (scaled)
    distance_reward = 2 * np.tanh(pos.x / 400.0) - 1
    
    # Stability and smoothness rewards: adjusted weights and scales
    angle_stability_penalty = -np.abs(state[0]) ** 0.5
    angular_velocity_stability_penalty = -np.abs(state[1]) ** 0.5
    action_smoothness_penalty = -np.sum(np.abs(action)) / len(action) ** 0.5
    
    # Obstacle penalty: adjusted scale and exponentiation
    obstacle_penalty = -np.min([l.fraction for l in self.lidar]) ** 2 * np.exp(-1)
    
    # Total reward: weighted sum with adjusted weights
    reward = (distance_reward + 0.25 * angle_stability_penalty
              + 0.25 * angular_velocity_stability_penalty
              + 0.5 * action_smoothness_penalty
              + 0.75 * obstacle_penalty)  # Higher weight given to obstacle penalty
    
    individual_reward = {
        "distance_reward": distance_reward,
        "angle_stability_penalty": angle_stability_penalty,
        "angular_velocity_stability_penalty": angular_velocity_stability_penalty,
        "action_smoothness_penalty": action_smoothness_penalty,
        "obstacle_penalty": obstacle_penalty,
    }
    
    return reward, individual_reward
```
This revised reward function aims to improve the policy's performance by:

* Encouraging movement towards the right while penalizing large angle and angular velocity.
* Adjusting the stability and smoothness rewards to prevent dominance during training.
* Increasing the weight of the obstacle penalty to encourage avoidance.

Please note that this is just a proposal, and further experimentation or fine-tuning may be necessary to achieve optimal performance.
