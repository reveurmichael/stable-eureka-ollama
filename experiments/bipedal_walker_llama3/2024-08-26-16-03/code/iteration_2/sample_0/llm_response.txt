Based on the provided feedback and tips for analyzing policy feedback, I will analyze each existing reward component and then propose an improved reward function.

**Fitness Score**
The fitness score is the ground truth evaluator, which suggests that it should be used as a reference to improve the reward function. However, since the fitness score is not increasing during training, it implies that the current reward function is not correctly guiding the policy towards better solutions.

**Reward Components**

1. **Distance Reward**: The values are quite high and varying. This could indicate that the distance-based reward is too strong or has a different scale than the other components.
2. **Stability Reward**: The values are negative, which is expected since the goal is to minimize stability penalties. However, the magnitude of the values is relatively small compared to others. This suggests that this component might not be playing a significant role in shaping the policy's behavior.
3. **Smoothness Reward**: The values are also negative and varying. This could indicate that the smoothness-based penalty is too strong or has a different scale than the other components.
4. **Obstacle Avoidance Reward**: The values are highly variable, which suggests that this component might be dominant in shaping the policy's behavior.

**Proposed Improved Reward Function**

Based on the analysis above, I propose the following improved reward function:

```
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    # Distance-based reward: moderate magnitude and bounded with tanh activation
    distance_reward = np.tanh(pos.x / 50.0)
    
    # Smoothness reward: moderate penalty for high-speed actions
    smoothness_penalty = -np.sum(np.abs(action)) / len(action)
    smoothness_reward = np.exp(smoothness_penalty / 2.0)  # Exponential scaling for higher penalty
    
    # Obstacle avoidance reward: encourage avoidance of obstacles with moderate magnitude
    obstacle_avoidance_reward = -np.min([l.fraction for l in self.lidar])
    obstacle_avoidance_reward = np.exp(obstacle_avoidance_reward)  # Exponential scaling for higher penalty
    
    # Total reward: a weighted sum with adjusted weights and normalized values
    reward = (distance_reward * 0.2 + smoothness_reward * 0.3 + obstacle_avoidance_reward * 0.5)
    
    individual_reward = {
        "distance_reward": distance_reward,
        "smoothness_reward": smoothness_reward,
        "obstacle_avoidance_reward": obstacle_avoidance_reward
    }
    
    return reward, individual_reward
```

**Key Changes**

1. Reduced the scale of the distance-based reward to make it more comparable with other components.
2. Increased the magnitude of the smoothness penalty to make it more significant in shaping the policy's behavior.
3. Adjusted the weights for the total reward to give more importance to obstacle avoidance and smoothness.
4. Normalized the values of each component to ensure that they are on a similar scale.

This improved reward function aims to better guide the policy towards optimal solutions by balancing the importance of distance, smoothness, and obstacle avoidance.
