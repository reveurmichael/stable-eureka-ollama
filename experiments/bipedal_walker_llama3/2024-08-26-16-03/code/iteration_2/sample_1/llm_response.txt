A challenging task!

After analyzing the feedback, I've identified some issues with the existing reward function. Here's my proposal for an improved reward function:

**Distance-based reward:** The magnitude of this component is relatively small compared to others. Considering it should incentivize movement to the right, let's scale it up and adjust its temperature.

**Simplified stability reward:** This component seems to be too focused on reducing penalties for small angles and velocities. Instead, let's introduce a new component that rewards stability directly.

**Smoothness reward:** The magnitude of this component is relatively high compared to others. Let's scale it down to moderate levels.

**Obstacle avoidance reward:** The exponential scaling is quite strong. Let's adjust the weights and consider an alternative way to encode obstacle avoidance.

Here's my proposed new reward function:

```python
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    # Distance-based reward: incentivize movement to the right with moderate magnitude
    distance_reward = np.tanh(pos.x / 50.0)  # Tanh activation for bounded rewards
    
    # Stability reward: directly reward stability and smoothness
    stability_smoothness_reward = -np.sum([state[0]**2, state[1]**2]) / len(state)
    stability_smoothness_reward = np.tanh(stability_smoothness_reward / 1.5)  # Tanh activation for bounded rewards
    
    # Smoothness reward: moderate penalty for high-speed actions
    action_smoothness_penalty = -np.sum(np.abs(action)) / len(action)
    smoothness_reward = np.exp(action_smoothness_penalty / -0.2)  # Exponential scaling with lower exponent
    
    # Obstacle avoidance reward: encourage avoidance of obstacles with moderate magnitude
    obstacle_avoidance_reward = -np.min([l.fraction for l in self.lidar]) * 0.3
    
    # Total reward: a weighted sum with adjusted weights
    reward = (distance_reward * 0.2
              + stability_smoothness_reward * 0.4
              + smoothness_reward * 0.1
              + obstacle_avoidance_reward)
    
    individual_reward = {
        "distance_reward": distance_reward,
        "stability_smoothness_reward": stability_smoothness_reward,
        "smoothness_reward": smoothness_reward,
        "obstacle_avoidance_reward": obstacle_avoidance_reward,
    }
    
    return reward, individual_reward
```

**Key changes:**

1. Adjusted the temperature of the distance-based reward to encourage movement.
2. Introduced a new stability_smoothness_reward component to directly reward stability and smoothness.
3. Scaled down the magnitude of the smoothness reward to moderate levels.
4. Adjusted the weights and penalty scaling in the obstacle avoidance reward.

This proposal should lead to improved performance and more effective policy learning.
