Based on the provided feedback and tips for analyzing policy feedback, I will analyze each existing reward component and then propose a new reward function.

**Analysis of existing reward components:**

1. **Distance-based reward:** The values are quite high, indicating that moving to the right is highly rewarded. This might be good for exploration but could lead to over-exploration.
2. **Simplified stability reward:** The penalty for small angles and velocities is moderate, which is good. However, the mean value of this component is low (-15.816242859014068), suggesting that it's not strongly influencing the policy.
3. **Smoothness reward:** The penalty for high-speed actions is moderate, which is good. However, the values are relatively high (around 0.5-1.0), indicating that smooth actions are highly rewarded.
4. **Obstacle avoidance reward:** The values are very low (-35 to -29), suggesting that avoiding obstacles is not strongly influencing the policy.

**Proposed new reward function:**

To better solve the task, I propose a new reward function that balances exploration and obstacle avoidance:

```
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    # Exploration-based reward: incentivize movement with moderate magnitude
    distance_reward = np.tanh(pos.x / 100.0)
    
    # Obstacle avoidance reward: strong penalty for collisions or close proximity to obstacles
    obstacle_avoidance_penalty = -np.min([l.fraction for l in self.lidar])
    obstacle_avoidance_penalty = np.exp(obstacle_avoidance_penalty)  # Exponential scaling for higher penalty
    
    # Smoothness and stability reward: moderate penalty for high-speed actions and small angles/velocities
    action_smoothness_penalty = -np.sum(np.abs(action)) / len(action)
    angle_stability_penalty = -np.abs(state[0]) ** 2
    angular_velocity_stability_penalty = -np.abs(state[1]) ** 2
    smoothness_reward = np.mean([angle_stability_penalty, angular_velocity_stability_penalty])
    
    # Total reward: a weighted sum with adjusted weights
    reward = (distance_reward * 0.4
              + obstacle_avoidance_penalty * 0.5
              + smoothness_reward * 0.1)
    
    individual_reward = {
        "distance_reward": distance_reward,
        "obstacle_avoidance_reward": obstacle_avoidance_penalty,
        "smoothness_reward": smoothness_reward,
    }
    
    return reward, individual_reward
```

**Changes:**

* Reduced the importance of the distance-based reward to encourage more exploration.
* Increased the importance of the obstacle avoidance penalty to strongly discourage collisions and close proximity to obstacles.
* Combined the smoothness and stability rewards into a single component with moderate magnitude.

This new reward function should better balance exploration, obstacle avoidance, and smooth motion.
