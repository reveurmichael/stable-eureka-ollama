What a fascinating task!

After analyzing the policy feedback and existing reward function, I've identified some areas for improvement. Here's my analysis:

1. **Fitness score**: The maximum value is around -4, while the mean is -15. This indicates that the current reward function is not effectively incentivizing the desired behavior.
2. **Reward components**:
	* **Distance-based reward**: The magnitude of this component is relatively small compared to others. It might not be having a significant impact on the policy's behavior.
	* **Simplified stability reward**: The penalty for small angles and velocities seems reasonable, but it's not clear how this interacts with the other components.
	* **Smoothness reward**: This penalty for high-speed actions is moderate in magnitude, which could be beneficial for encouraging smooth movement.
	* **Obstacle avoidance reward**: The exponential scaling makes this component more significant, but its impact might be outweighed by other factors.

Considering these observations, I propose the following improved reward function:

```python
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    # Simplified stability reward: reduce penalty for small angles and velocities
    angle_stability_penalty = -np.abs(state[0]) ** 2
    angular_velocity_stability_penalty = -np.abs(state[1]) ** 2
    stability_reward = np.mean([angle_stability_penalty, angular_velocity_stability_penalty])
    
    # Smoothness reward: moderate penalty for high-speed actions
    action_smoothness_penalty = -np.sum(np.abs(action)) / len(action)
    smoothness_reward = np.tanh(action_smoothness_penalty / 0.5)
    
    # Obstacle avoidance reward: maintain exponential scaling, but reduce magnitude
    obstacle_avoidance_reward = -np.min([l.fraction for l in self.lidar])
    obstacle_avoidance_reward = np.exp(obstacle_avoidance_reward) * 0.2
    
    # Distance-based reward: increased magnitude to encourage movement to the right
    distance_reward = np.tanh(pos.x / 200.0)
    
    # Proximity to goal (not explicitly mentioned): moderate reward for approaching the goal
    goal_distance_reward = np.exp(-(pos.y - self.goal_y) ** 2) * 0.1
    
    # Total reward: a weighted sum with adjusted weights
    reward = stability_reward * 0.3 + smoothness_reward * 0.15 + obstacle_avoidance_reward * 0.1 + distance_reward * 0.2 + goal_distance_reward * 0.05
    
    individual_reward = {
        "stability_reward": stability_reward,
        "smoothness_reward": smoothness_reward,
        "obstacle_avoidance_reward": obstacle_avoidance_reward,
        "distance_reward": distance_reward,
        "goal_distance_reward": goal_distance_reward,
    }
    
    return reward, individual_reward
```

Key changes:

* Simplified the stability reward to focus on reducing penalty for small angles and velocities.
* Reduced the magnitude of the obstacle avoidance reward to balance it with other components.
* Increased the magnitude of the distance-based reward to encourage movement to the right.
* Introduced a goal distance reward to incentivize approaching the goal.

These changes should lead to an improved policy that balances stability, smoothness, obstacle avoidance, and distance-based rewards.
