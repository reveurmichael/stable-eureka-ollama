Based on the provided feedback and tips for analyzing policy feedback, I'll analyze each existing reward component and then propose a new reward function.

**Analysis of Existing Reward Components**

1. **Distance-based reward**: The values are reasonable, but it's not clear if this component is providing a strong incentive to move towards the right.
2. **Simplified stability reward**: The mean value is quite low (-15.816242859014068), indicating that this component may be too harsh. This could be due to the squared penalty for small angles and velocities, which might lead to an overemphasis on stability.
3. **Smoothness reward**: The values are relatively low (min: -4.079251257734441, mean: -15.816242859014068), suggesting that this component may not be providing a strong incentive for smooth actions.
4. **Obstacle avoidance reward**: The exponential scaling might be amplifying the penalty too much, as the values are quite high (max: 511.9759519174695). This could be due to the min function used to compute the obstacle distance.

**New Reward Function Proposal**

Based on the analysis, I'll propose a new reward function that addresses the issues with the existing components:

```python
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    # Distance-based reward: moderate incentive for movement towards the right
    distance_reward = np.tanh(pos.x / 50.0)  # Reduced magnitude

    # Simplified stability reward: reduce penalty for small angles and velocities
    angle_stability_penalty = -np.abs(state[0])  # Linear penalty instead of squared
    angular_velocity_stability_penalty = -np.abs(state[1])
    stability_reward = np.mean([angle_stability_penalty, angular_velocity_stability_penalty])

    # Smoothness reward: moderate incentive for smooth actions
    action_smoothness_incentive = np.sum(np.abs(action)) / len(action)  # Inverse of penalty
    smoothness_reward = np.tanh(action_smoothness_incentive / 0.1)

    # Obstacle avoidance reward: reduced exponential scaling and a more realistic distance metric
    obstacle_distance = np.mean([l.distance for l in self.lidar])  # Mean distance to all lidar points
    obstacle_avoidance_reward = -np.exp(-obstacle_distance / 10.0)  # Reduced penalty

    # Total reward: weighted sum with adjusted weights
    reward = (distance_reward * 0.2
              + stability_reward * 0.3
              + smoothness_reward * 0.1
              + obstacle_avoidance_reward * 0.4)
    
    individual_reward = {
        "distance_reward": distance_reward,
        "stability_reward": stability_reward,
        "smoothness_reward": smoothness_reward,
        "obstacle_avoidance_reward": obstacle_avoidance_reward,
    }
    
    return reward, individual_reward
```

The main changes are:

* Reduced the magnitude of the distance-based reward.
* Changed the simplified stability reward to a linear penalty for small angles and velocities.
* Inverted the smoothness penalty to create an incentive for smooth actions.
* Modified the obstacle avoidance reward to use a mean distance metric and reduced exponential scaling.

These changes should provide a more balanced reward function that encourages movement towards the right, stability, smooth actions, and obstacle avoidance.
