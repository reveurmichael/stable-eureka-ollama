Analyzing the feedback:

1. The fitness score values are diverse, with a max of 1285.5425436180974 and a min of 1269.4010001724114. This suggests that the current reward function is not aligned well with the desired policy.

2. The existing reward components' magnitudes are quite different. For example, "obstacle_avoidance_reward" has values in the order of 10^(-1), while "fitness_score" has values in the order of 10^3. This suggests that the scale of the reward function needs to be adjusted.

3. The fitness score is not improving during training, which suggests that the current reward function may not be driving the policy towards the desired behavior.

Given these observations, I propose a new reward function:

```
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    # Distance-based reward: incentivize movement to the right with moderate magnitude
    distance_reward = np.tanh(pos.x / 100.0)  # Tanh activation for bounded rewards
    
    # Simplified stability reward: reduce penalty for small angles and velocities
    angle_stability_penalty = -np.abs(state[0]) ** 2
    angular_velocity_stability_penalty = -np.abs(state[1]) ** 2
    stability_reward = np.mean([angle_stability_penalty, angular_velocity_stability_penalty])
    
    # Smoothness reward: moderate penalty for high-speed actions
    action_smoothness_penalty = -np.sum(np.abs(action)) / len(action)
    smoothness_reward = np.tanh(action_smoothness_penalty / 0.5)
    
    # Proximity to Lidar points: encourage avoidance of obstacles with moderate magnitude
    obstacle_avoidance_reward = -np.min([l.fraction for l in self.lidar])
    obstacle_avoidance_reward = np.exp(obstacle_avoidance_reward)  # Exponential scaling for higher penalty
    
    # Fitness score reward: scale fitness scores to the same range as other rewards
    fitness_score_reward = (fitness_scores_max - fitness_scores_min) * np.tanh((fitness_scores - fitness_scores_mean) / (2 * fitness_scores_std)) + fitness_scores_mean
    
    # Total reward: a weighted sum with adjusted weights
    reward = (distance_reward * 0.3
              + stability_reward * 0.15
              + smoothness_reward * 0.1
              + obstacle_avvoidance_reward * 0.2
              + fitness_score_reward * 0.4)
    
    individual_reward = {
        "distance_reward": distance_reward,
        "stability_reward": stability_reward,
        "smoothness_reward": smoothness_reward,
        "obstacle_avoidance_reward": obstacle_avoidance_reward,
        "fitness_score_reward": fitness_score_reward
    }
    
    return reward, individual_reward

```

The key changes are:

* Scaling the fitness score reward to the same range as other rewards using `tanh` activation.
* Adjusting the weights for each component based on the analysis of the feedback.
* Re-scaling "obstacle_avoidance_reward" to match the magnitude of other rewards.
