A challenging task!

After analyzing the feedback, I've identified some issues with the existing reward function. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Fitness score**: The mean fitness score is -15.816242859014068, indicating that the agent is not maximizing the fitness score during training.
2. **Reward components**: Some reward components have very similar values or are not contributing significantly to the overall reward.
3. **Magnitude**: The magnitude of some reward components is much larger than others, which might dominate the total reward.

Based on these observations, I propose a revised reward function that addresses these issues:

**New Reward Function Proposal**

```
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    # Distance-based reward: incentivize movement to the right with moderate magnitude
    distance_reward = np.tanh(pos.x / 100.0)
    
    # Simplified stability reward: reduce penalty for small angles and velocities
    angle_stability_penalty = -np.abs(state[0]) ** 2
    angular_velocity_stability_penalty = -np.abs(state[1]) ** 2
    stability_reward = np.mean([angle_stability_penalty, angular_velocity_stability_penalty])
    
    # Smoothness reward: moderate penalty for high-speed actions
    action_smoothness_penalty = -np.sum(np.abs(action)) / len(action)
    smoothness_reward = np.tanh(action_smoothness_penalty / 0.5)
    
    # Proximity to Lidar points: encourage avoidance of obstacles with moderate magnitude
    obstacle_avoidance_reward = -np.min([l.fraction for l in self.lidar]) ** 2
    
    # Total reward: a weighted sum with adjusted weights
    reward = (distance_reward * 0.5
              + stability_reward * 0.3
              + smoothness_reward * 0.1
              + obstacle_avoidance_reward * 0.1)
    
    individual_reward = {
        "distance_reward": distance_reward,
        "stability_reward": stability_reward,
        "smoothness_reward": smoothness_reward,
        "obstacle_avoidance_reward": obstacle_avoidance_reward,
    }
    
    return reward, individual_reward
```

Changes made:

1. **Scaled down** the magnitude of the `distance_reward` to make it more comparable to other components.
2. **Re-weighted** the components to prioritize the fitness score (i.e., distance-based reward) and stability reward, while still maintaining a penalty for high-speed actions and obstacle avoidance.
3. **Simplified** the stability reward by using the mean of the angle and velocity penalties instead of summing them.

These changes should help improve the agent's performance in maximizing the fitness score during training.
