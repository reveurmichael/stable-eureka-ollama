Based on the provided feedback, I'll analyze each existing reward component and propose improvements to the reward function.

**Analysis of Existing Reward Components**

1. **Distance-based reward**: The magnitude of this reward is relatively small compared to others, but it's consistent in its behavior.
2. **Simplified stability reward**: This component has a large range (-0.5 to 0), which might be causing issues during training. Additionally, the penalty for small angles and velocities seems too harsh (i.e., -0.25).
3. **Smoothness reward**: This component also has a significant magnitude (-1 to 1) and might be dominating the overall reward calculation.
4. **Obstacle avoidance reward**: The exponential scaling increases the penalty for obstacle proximity, which is good. However, the minimum fraction value is not well bounded (could be high or low), which might cause issues during training.

**Proposed Reward Function**

To address these concerns and improve the policy feedback, I suggest modifying the existing reward function as follows:

```python
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    # Distance-based reward: incentivize movement to the right with moderate magnitude
    distance_reward = np.tanh(pos.x / 100.0)

    # Simplified stability reward: reduce penalty for small angles and velocities (scaled)
    angle_stability_penalty = -np.abs(state[0]) ** 2 * 0.1  # Reduced penalty
    angular_velocity_stability_penalty = -np.abs(state[1]) ** 2 * 0.05  # Reduced penalty
    stability_reward = np.mean([angle_stability_penalty, angular_velocity_stability_penalty])

    # Smoothness reward: moderate penalty for high-speed actions (scaled)
    action_smoothness_penalty = -np.sum(np.abs(action)) / len(action) * 0.2  # Scaled penalty
    smoothness_reward = np.tanh(action_smoothness_penalty)

    # Obstacle avoidance reward: encourage avoidance of obstacles with moderate magnitude (bounded)
    obstacle_avoidance_reward = -np.clip(np.min([l.fraction for l in self.lidar]), -1, 0)  # Bounded penalty

    # Total reward: a weighted sum with adjusted weights
    reward = (distance_reward * 0.25
              + stability_reward * 0.15
              + smoothness_reward * 0.05
              + obstacle_avoidance_reward * 0.55)

    individual_reward = {
        "distance_reward": distance_reward,
        "stability_reward": stability_reward,
        "smoothness_reward": smoothness_reward,
        "obstacle_avoidance_reward": obstacle_avoidance_reward,
    }

    return reward, individual_reward
```

**Changes:**

1. Reduced the penalty for small angles and velocities in the Simplified stability reward component.
2. Scaled down the Smoothness reward to reduce its impact on the overall reward calculation.
3. Bounded the Obstacle avoidance reward by clipping it between -1 and 0, ensuring a more consistent magnitude.

These changes should help improve the policy feedback and encourage more effective exploration-exploitation trade-offs during training.
