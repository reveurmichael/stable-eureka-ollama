A challenging task! Let's analyze the feedback and propose an improved reward function.

**Obstacle avoidance reward**: This component has a maximum value of 0.0, which means it doesn't encourage obstacle avoidance at all. Considering its purpose is to discourage obstacles, we should make it negative and increase its magnitude. However, since it has no variation in values, we might need to add some noise or introduce complexity.

**Fitness score**: This component has a clear direction (maximize), but its magnitude is quite low compared to others. We should scale it up to match the other components' magnitudes.

**Reward**: The mean value of this component is around 17.76, which indicates that our agent is generally moving in the right direction. However, we want to encourage more exploration and diverse behaviors. We can increase its magnitude by scaling up the weights or introducing new components.

Now, let's rewrite the reward function with these insights:

```python
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    # Distance-based reward: incentivize movement to the right with moderate magnitude
    distance_reward = np.tanh(pos.x / 100.0)

    # Simplified stability reward: reduce penalty for small angles and velocities (scaled)
    angle_stability_penalty = -np.abs(state[0]) ** 2 * 0.5  # Increased penalty
    angular_velocity_stability_penalty = -np.abs(state[1]) ** 2 * 0.25  # Reduced penalty
    stability_reward = np.mean([angle_stability_penalty, angular_velocity_stability_penalty])

    # Smoothness reward: moderate penalty for high-speed actions (scaled)
    action_smoothness_penalty = -np.sum(np.abs(action)) / len(action) * 0.3  # Scaled penalty
    smoothness_reward = np.tanh(action_smoothness_penalty)

    # Obstacle avoidance reward: encourage avoidance of obstacles with negative magnitude and noise
    obstacle_avoidance_reward = -np.clip(np.min([l.fraction for l in self.lidar]) + np.random.normal(0, 0.1), -1, 0)  # Added noise

    # Fitness score: scaled up to match other components' magnitudes
    fitness_score = 10 * (fitness_score_value - 20)

    # Total reward: a weighted sum with adjusted weights
    reward = (distance_reward * 0.2
              + stability_reward * 0.15
              + smoothness_reward * 0.05
              + obstacle_avoidance_reward * 0.3
              + fitness_score * 0.4)

    individual_reward = {
        "distance_reward": distance_reward,
        "stability_reward": stability_reward,
        "smoothness_reward": smoothness_reward,
        "obstacle_avoidance_reward": obstacle_avoidance_reward,
        "fitness_score": fitness_score
    }

    return reward, individual_reward
```

In this proposal, I've increased the magnitude of the fitness score and obstacle avoidance rewards. I've also introduced some noise to the obstacle avoidance component to encourage more exploration. The weights for each component have been adjusted to balance the rewards.

Please note that this is just a suggestion based on my analysis. You may need to fine-tune the reward function further by experimenting with different weight combinations or introducing new components.
