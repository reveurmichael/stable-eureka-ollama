Based on the feedback data provided, I will analyze each existing reward component and propose an improved reward function.

1. **Obstacle avoidance reward**: The values are all zeros, indicating that the agent does not learn to avoid obstacles effectively. This might be due to the penalty being too small or the obstacle detection mechanism not working well. I would recommend increasing the magnitude of this component or re-writing it to make it more effective.
2. **Fitness score**: Although this is the ground truth evaluator, its values are negative and relatively high. Since we want to maximize fitness scores, I would suggest scaling these values up to be around 0-1 range.
3. **Reward**: The values of this component are mostly positive, indicating that the agent learns to take actions that lead to a positive reward. However, the magnitude of this component is quite large compared to others. To bring it into perspective with other components, I would recommend scaling it down.

Now, let's analyze the existing reward function:

* The distance-based reward seems reasonable.
* The stability reward has been simplified and reduced in magnitude, which might be a good thing since it's not improving the fitness score.
* The smoothness reward is also reasonable, but its penalty is quite small compared to others. Increasing this penalty might help improve the agent's performance.
* The obstacle avoidance reward is ineffective as mentioned earlier.

Based on these findings, I would propose an improved reward function:

```python
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    # Distance-based reward: incentivize movement to the right with moderate magnitude
    distance_reward = np.tanh(pos.x / 100.0)

    # Simplified stability reward: reduce penalty for small angles and velocities (scaled)
    angle_stability_penalty = -np.abs(state[0]) ** 2 * 0.05  # Reduced penalty
    angular_velocity_stability_penalty = -np.abs(state[1]) ** 2 * 0.02  # Reduced penalty
    stability_reward = np.mean([angle_stability_penalty, angular_velocity_stability_penalty])

    # Smoothness reward: moderate to high penalty for high-speed actions (scaled)
    action_smoothness_penalty = -np.sum(np.abs(action)) / len(action) * 0.5  # Scaled penalty
    smoothness_reward = np.tanh(action_smoothness_penalty)

    # Obstacle avoidance reward: encourage avoidance of obstacles with high magnitude (bounded)
    obstacle_avoidance_reward = -np.clip(np.min([l.fraction for l in self.lidar]), -1, 0.8)  # Bounded penalty

    # Total reward: a weighted sum with adjusted weights
    reward = (distance_reward * 0.3
              + stability_reward * 0.2
              + smoothness_reward * 0.15
              + obstacle_avoidance_reward * 0.35)

    individual_reward = {
        "distance_reward": distance_reward,
        "stability_reward": stability_reward,
        "smoothness_reward": smoothness_reward,
        "obstacle_avoidance_reward": obstacle_avoidance_reward,
    }

    return reward, individual_reward
```

The main changes I made were:

* Increased the magnitude of the obstacle avoidance penalty to encourage more effective avoidance.
* Scaled down the distance-based and stability rewards to make them less dominant in the total reward.
* Increased the smoothness reward's penalty to encourage smoother actions.
* Adjusted the weights of the individual components to achieve a better balance between exploration, stability, and obstacle avoidance.
