After analyzing the feedback, I noticed that:

1. The `fitness_score` component has a much larger magnitude than other components. This could be due to its role as the ground truth evaluator.
2. The `reward` component has high values, which might not be aligned with the optimization goal of minimizing the fitness score.
3. The `obstacle_avoidance_reward` component is always 0, indicating that obstacles are being avoided effectively.

To improve the reward function, I propose the following changes:

1. Scale down the magnitude of the `fitness_score` to make it comparable to other components.
2. Modify the `reward` component to be a weighted sum of the individual rewards, with weights adjusted based on their importance in the task.
3. Remove the `obstacle_avoidance_reward` component since it's not providing any additional information.

Here is the revised reward function code proposal:

```
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    # Distance-based reward: incentivize movement to the right with moderate magnitude
    distance_reward = np.tanh(pos.x / 100.0)

    # Simplified stability reward: reduce penalty for small angles and velocities (scaled)
    angle_stability_penalty = -np.abs(state[0]) ** 2 * 0.1  # Reduced penalty
    angular_velocity_stability_penalty = -np.abs(state[1]) ** 2 * 0.05  # Reduced penalty
    stability_reward = np.mean([angle_stability_penalty, angular_velocity_stability_penalty])

    # Smoothness reward: moderate penalty for high-speed actions (scaled)
    action_smoothness_penalty = -np.sum(np.abs(action)) / len(action) * 0.2  # Scaled penalty
    smoothness_reward = np.tanh(action_smoothness_penalty)

    # Fitness score as the main objective to minimize
    fitness_score = -fitness_score_value

    # Total reward: a weighted sum with adjusted weights
    reward = (distance_reward * 0.1 + stability_reward * 0.2 + smoothness_reward * 0.3 + fitness_score * 0.4)

    individual_rewards = {
        "distance_reward": distance_reward,
        "stability_reward": stability_reward,
        "smoothness_reward": smoothness_reward,
    }

    return reward, individual_rewards
```

This revised reward function aims to strike a balance between the different components and prioritize minimizing the fitness score.
