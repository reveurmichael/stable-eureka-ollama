Analyzing the feedback:

1. Obstacle avoidance reward: The values are all zeros, indicating that the agent has not been able to avoid obstacles effectively. This could be due to the bounded penalty being too strict or the weights being misaligned.

2. Fitness score: The maximum value is -13.025602000765524, which indicates that the fitness score is not improving during training. This suggests that the reward function is not well-designed to maximize the fitness score.

3. Reward: The mean of the rewards is 17.7558416769607, indicating that the agent is receiving positive rewards on average. However, the minimum value is 14.144731273525394, which could be too high and preventing the agent from improving further.

4. Episode length: The episode lengths are all identical, suggesting that the episodes are not ending prematurely or being terminated early due to a specific condition.

Considering these observations, I propose an updated reward function:

```
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    # Distance-based reward: incentivize movement to the right with moderate magnitude
    distance_reward = np.tanh(pos.x / 100.0)

    # Simplified stability reward: reduce penalty for small angles and velocities (scaled)
    angle_stability_penalty = -np.abs(state[0]) ** 2 * 0.05  # Reduced penalty
    angular_velocity_stability_penalty = -np.abs(state[1]) ** 2 * 0.025  # Reduced penalty
    stability_reward = np.mean([angle_stability_penalty, angular_velocity_stability_penalty])

    # Smoothness reward: moderate penalty for high-speed actions (scaled)
    action_smoothness_penalty = -np.sum(np.abs(action)) / len(action) * 0.1  # Scaled penalty
    smoothness_reward = np.tanh(action_smoothness_penalty)

    # Obstacle avoidance reward: encourage avoidance of obstacles with moderate magnitude (bounded)
    obstacle_avoidance_reward = np.clip(-np.min([l.fraction for l in self.lidar]), -1, 0) * 0.5  # Bounded and weighted penalty

    # Fitness score reward: incentivize achieving higher fitness scores
    fitness_score_reward = np.tanh(self.fitness_score / 50.0)

    # Total reward: a weighted sum with adjusted weights
    reward = (distance_reward * 0.3
              + stability_reward * 0.2
              + smoothness_reward * 0.1
              + obstacle_avvoidance_reward * 0.4
              + fitness_score_reward * 0.5)

    individual_reward = {
        "distance_reward": distance_reward,
        "stability_reward": stability_reward,
        "smoothness_reward": smoothness_reward,
        "obstacle_avoidance_reward": obstacle_avoidance_reward,
        "fitness_score_reward": fitness_score_reward
    }

    return reward, individual_reward
```

Changes:

1. Reduced the magnitude of the stability and angular velocity penalties to encourage more exploration.

2. Increased the weight of the fitness score reward to incentivize achieving higher scores.

3. Introduced a new reward component for obstacle avoidance, bounded between -1 and 0, with a moderate weight.

4. Adjusted the weights of the other components to balance the rewards.

This updated reward function should provide more guidance to the agent to achieve better results in terms of fitness score and obstacle avoidance.
