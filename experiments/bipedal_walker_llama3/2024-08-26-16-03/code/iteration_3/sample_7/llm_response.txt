Based on the feedback, I will analyze each existing reward component and provide suggestions for improvement.

1. **Obstacle avoidance reward**: The values are all zeros, which indicates that the agent is not learning to avoid obstacles effectively. This suggests either:
   a. Changing the scale or temperature parameter of this component.
   b. Re-writing the component.
   c. Discarding the component (as it's currently not contributing to the overall reward).

2. **Fitness score**: The values are all negative, which indicates that the agent is not maximizing the fitness score during training. This suggests:
   a. Changing the scale or temperature parameter of this component.

3. **Reward**: The values are mostly positive, which indicates that the agent is generally moving in the right direction (pun intended). However, there is no clear pattern to maximize or minimize these values.

4. **Episode length**: The values are all 1600.0, indicating that the agent is not exploring different episode lengths during training.

To improve the reward function, I will combine the insights from the previous analysis:

1. Remove the obstacle avoidance reward component as it's not contributing to the overall reward.
2. Scale the fitness score by a factor of 10 (fitness_score * 10) to emphasize its importance in the overall reward.
3. Adjust the weights for the remaining components: distance_reward (0.5), stability_reward (0.1), smoothness_reward (0.05).
4. Remove episode length from the reward function as it's not contributing to the agent's learning.

Here is the proposed improved reward function code:

```Python
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    # Distance-based reward: incentivize movement to the right with moderate magnitude
    distance_reward = np.tanh(pos.x / 100.0)

    # Simplified stability reward: reduce penalty for small angles and velocities (scaled)
    angle_stability_penalty = -np.abs(state[0]) ** 2 * 0.1  # Reduced penalty
    angular_velocity_stability_penalty = -np.abs(state[1]) ** 2 * 0.05  # Reduced penalty
    stability_reward = np.mean([angle_stability_penalty, angular_velocity_stability_penalty])

    # Smoothness reward: moderate penalty for high-speed actions (scaled)
    action_smoothness_penalty = -np.sum(np.abs(action)) / len(action) * 0.2  # Scaled penalty
    smoothness_reward = np.tanh(action_smoothness_penalty)

    # Fitness score reward: emphasize fitness score importance
    fitness_score_reward = self.fitness_score * 10

    # Total reward: a weighted sum with adjusted weights
    reward = (distance_reward * 0.5
              + stability_reward * 0.1
              + smoothness_reward * 0.05
              + fitness_score_reward)

    individual_reward = {
        "distance_reward": distance_reward,
        "stability_reward": stability_reward,
        "smoothness_reward": smoothness_reward,
        "fitness_score_reward": fitness_score_reward,
    }

    return reward, individual_reward
```

This improved reward function aims to balance the importance of different components and encourage the agent to move towards the right while maintaining stability, smoothness, and maximizing the fitness score.
