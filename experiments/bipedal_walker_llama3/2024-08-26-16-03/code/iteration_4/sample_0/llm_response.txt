Based on the feedback provided, I will analyze each existing reward component and then write a new proposal for an improved reward function.

**Analysis of Existing Reward Components**

1. **Distance-based reward**: The values are close to -0.5, which suggests that the agent is not incentivized to move to the right. This component may need re-scaling or re-writing.
2. **Simplified stability reward**: The values are around 0-0.1, indicating a relatively flat response. This could be due to the reduced penalty for small angles and velocities, which might not effectively encourage stability. We should consider increasing the magnitude of this reward component.
3. **Smoothness reward**: The values range from -0.5 to -0.2, suggesting that high-speed actions are penalized as intended. However, the magnitude is relatively low compared to other components, so we may want to increase the scale of this reward.
4. **Obstacle avoidance reward**: The values are mostly around 0-0.8, indicating that obstacle avoidance is not being effectively encouraged. We should consider increasing the magnitude of this reward component.

**New Reward Function Proposal**

Based on the analysis above, I propose a new reward function that addresses the issues with each component:

```
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    # Distance-based reward: incentivize movement to the right with moderate-high magnitude
    distance_reward = np.tanh(pos.x / 50.0) * 1.5

    # Stability reward: increase penalty for large angles and velocities (scaled)
    angle_stability_penalty = -np.abs(state[0]) ** 2 * 0.2
    angular_velocity_stability_penalty = -np.abs(state[1]) ** 2 * 0.1
    stability_reward = np.mean([angle_stability_penalty, angular_velocity_stability_penalty])

    # Smoothness reward: moderate to high penalty for high-speed actions (scaled)
    action_smoothness_penalty = -np.sum(np.abs(action)) / len(action) * 1.5
    smoothness_reward = np.tanh(action_smoothness_penalty)

    # Obstacle avoidance reward: encourage avoidance of obstacles with high magnitude (bounded)
    obstacle_avoidance_reward = -np.clip(np.min([l.fraction for l in self.lidar]), -1, 0.9)

    # Total reward: a weighted sum with adjusted weights
    reward = (distance_reward * 0.4
              + stability_reward * 0.3
              + smoothness_reward * 0.2
              + obstacle_avoidance_reward * 0.5)

    individual_reward = {
        "distance_reward": distance_reward,
        "stability_reward": stability_reward,
        "smoothness_reward": smoothness_reward,
        "obstacle_avoidance_reward": obstacle_avoidance_reward,
    }

    return reward, individual_reward
```

This new proposal addresses the issues with each component by:

* Increasing the magnitude of the distance-based and obstacle avoidance rewards to better incentivize movement to the right and avoid obstacles.
* Increasing the scale of the smoothness reward to better penalize high-speed actions.
* Increasing the penalty for large angles and velocities in the stability reward.

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns about this proposal!
