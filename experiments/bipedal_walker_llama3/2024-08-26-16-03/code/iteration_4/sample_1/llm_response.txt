Based on the feedback and tips provided, I'll analyze each existing reward component and propose improvements.

**Distance-based reward**: The values are mostly negative, indicating a penalty for not moving to the right. This seems correct, but the magnitude could be adjusted for better performance.

**Simplified stability reward**: The values are also negative, indicating a penalty for small angles and velocities. However, this reward component is quite large compared to others. Consider reducing its impact or adjusting the scaling factors.

**Smoothness reward**: The values are mostly negative, indicating a penalty for high-speed actions. This seems correct, but the magnitude could be adjusted for better performance.

**Obstacle avoidance reward**: The values are mostly negative, indicating a penalty for not avoiding obstacles. This is expected behavior.

Now, let's create an improved reward function proposal:
```python
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    # Distance-based reward: incentivize movement to the right with moderate magnitude (reduced)
    distance_reward = np.tanh(pos.x / 50.0) * 0.2

    # Simplified stability reward: reduce penalty for small angles and velocities (scaled)
    angle_stability_penalty = -np.abs(state[0]) ** 2 * 0.01  # Reduced penalty
    angular_velocity_stability_penalty = -np.abs(state[1]) ** 2 * 0.005  # Reduced penalty
    stability_reward = np.mean([angle_stability_penalty, angular_velocity_stability_penalty]) * 0.15

    # Smoothness reward: moderate to high penalty for high-speed actions (reduced)
    action_smoothness_penalty = -np.sum(np.abs(action)) / len(action) * 0.2  # Reduced penalty
    smoothness_reward = np.tanh(action_smoothness_penalty) * 0.1

    # Obstacle avoidance reward: encourage avoidance of obstacles with high magnitude (bounded)
    obstacle_avoidance_reward = -np.clip(np.min([l.fraction for l in self.lidar]), -1, 0.8)  # Bounded penalty

    # Total reward: a weighted sum with adjusted weights
    reward = (distance_reward * 0.2
              + stability_reward
              + smoothness_reward
              + obstacle_avoidance_reward * 0.3)

    individual_reward = {
        "distance_reward": distance_reward,
        "stability_reward": stability_reward,
        "smoothness_reward": smoothness_reward,
        "obstacle_avoidance_reward": obstacle_avoidance_reward,
    }

    return reward, individual_reward
```
The proposed changes:

1. Reduced the magnitude of the distance-based reward to encourage more exploration.
2. Reduced the penalty for small angles and velocities in the stability reward.
3. Reduced the penalty for high-speed actions in the smoothness reward.
4. Adjusted the weights of the total reward to prioritize obstacle avoidance.

These adjustments should help improve the agent's performance by providing a more balanced reward structure.
