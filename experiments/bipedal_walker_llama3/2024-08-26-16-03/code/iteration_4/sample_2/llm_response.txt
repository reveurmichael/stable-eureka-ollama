Based on the provided feedback and analysis tips, I will analyze each existing reward component and propose a new reward function.

**Analyze Existing Reward Components**

1. **Distance-based reward**: The values are relatively small, ranging from -0.095 to 0. This suggests that this component is not strongly contributing to the overall reward signal.
2. **Simplified stability reward**: The mean value is around -3.56, which indicates a strong penalty for unstable states. However, the maximum value is only -3.09, which might be too low to effectively discourage instability.
3. **Smoothness reward**: The values are relatively small, ranging from -0.31 to 0. This suggests that this component is not strongly contributing to the overall reward signal either.
4. **Obstacle avoidance reward**: The maximum value is around -0.8, which indicates a strong penalty for not avoiding obstacles.

**New Reward Function Proposal**

Based on the analysis, I will modify the existing components and add new ones to create a more effective reward function.

```python
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    # Distance-based reward: incentivize movement to the right with moderate magnitude
    distance_reward = np.tanh(pos.x / 100.0) * 0.5
    
    # Improved stability reward: reduce penalty for small angles and velocities (scaled)
    angle_stability_penalty = -np.abs(state[0]) ** 2 * 0.1
    angular_velocity_stability_penalty = -np.abs(state[1]) ** 2 * 0.05
    stability_reward = np.mean([angle_stability_penalty, angular_velocity_stability_penalty])
    
    # Smoothness reward: moderate to high penalty for high-speed actions (scaled)
    action_smoothness_penalty = -np.sum(np.abs(action)) / len(action) * 1.0
    smoothness_reward = np.tanh(action_smoothness_penalty)
    
    # Obstacle avoidance reward: encourage avoidance of obstacles with high magnitude (bounded)
    obstacle_avoidance_reward = -np.clip(np.min([l.fraction for l in self.lidar]), -1, 0.9)
    
    # New component: direction-based reward: incentivize movement towards the goal
    direction_reward = np.tanh((pos.x - self.goal[0]) / 100.0) * 0.5
    
    # Total reward: a weighted sum with adjusted weights
    reward = (distance_reward * 0.2
              + stability_reward * 0.3
              + smoothness_reward * 0.1
              + obstacle_avoidance_reward * 0.2
              + direction_reward * 0.3)
    
    individual_reward = {
        "distance_reward": distance_reward,
        "stability_reward": stability_reward,
        "smoothness_reward": smoothness_reward,
        "obstacle_avoidance_reward": obstacle_avoidance_reward,
        "direction_reward": direction_reward,
    }
    
    return reward, individual_reward
```

The new reward function adds a **direction-based reward** component that incentivizes the agent to move towards the goal. I also adjusted the weights and scaling factors for each component based on their relative importance in the task.

This revised reward function should better guide the agent towards solving the task by balancing exploration, stability, smoothness, obstacle avoidance, and direction towards the goal.
