A challenging task!

After analyzing the policy feedback and existing reward function, I've identified some issues and opportunities for improvement. Here's a summary of my findings:

1. **Reward components with similar values**: The "distance_reward" and "smoothness_reward" have nearly identical values, which may indicate that they are not providing distinct information to the agent. This could be due to the `np.tanh` function used in both components, which tends to reduce the magnitude of the output.
2. **Inconsistent scaling**: The "angle_stability_penalty" and "angular_velocity_stability_penalty" have significantly larger values than the other reward components. This may indicate that these penalties are too strong or not well-scaled.
3. **Lack of correlation between reward components**: The existing reward function does not seem to encourage a coherent behavior, as different components focus on distinct aspects (e.g., movement, stability, smoothness, and obstacle avoidance). This could lead to suboptimal solutions.

To address these issues, I propose the following revised reward function:

```python
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    # Distance-based reward: incentivize movement to the right with moderate magnitude
    distance_reward = np.tanh(pos.x / 100.0)

    # Simplified stability reward: reduce penalty for small angles and velocities (scaled)
    angle_stability_penalty = -np.abs(state[0]) ** 2 * 0.01  # Reduced penalty
    angular_velocity_stability_penalty = -np.abs(state[1]) ** 2 * 0.005  # Reduced penalty
    stability_reward = np.mean([angle_stability_penalty, angular_velocity_stability_penalty])

    # Smoothness reward: moderate to high penalty for high-speed actions (scaled)
    action_smoothness_penalty = -np.sum(np.abs(action)) / len(action) * 0.2  # Scaled penalty
    smoothness_reward = np.tanh(action_smoothness_penalty)

    # Obstacle avoidance reward: encourage avoidance of obstacles with high magnitude (bounded)
    obstacle_avoidance_reward = -np.clip(np.min([l.fraction for l in self.lidar]), -1, 0.5)  # Bounded penalty

    # Total reward: a weighted sum with adjusted weights
    reward = (distance_reward * 0.4
              + stability_reward * 0.3
              + smoothness_reward * 0.2
              + obstacle_avoidance_reward * 0.1)

    individual_reward = {
        "distance_reward": distance_reward,
        "stability_reward": stability_reward,
        "smoothness_reward": smoothness_reward,
        "obstacle_avoidance_reward": obstacle_avoidance_reward,
    }

    return reward, individual_reward
```

Key changes:

* Reduced the magnitude of the "angle_stability_penalty" and "angular_velocity_stability_penalty" to make them less dominant.
* Increased the weight of the "distance_reward" to emphasize movement towards the right.
* Adjusted the weights of the other components to encourage a more balanced behavior.

This revised reward function should provide a better trade-off between exploration, stability, smoothness, and obstacle avoidance.
