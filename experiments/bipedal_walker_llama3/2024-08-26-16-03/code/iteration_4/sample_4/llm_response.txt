The task at hand!

Let's analyze each existing reward component:

1. **Distance-based reward**: The values are all negative and relatively similar in magnitude (-0.05 to -0.08). This suggests that the agent is not incentivized to move towards the right, as the distance-based reward seems to be too weak.
2. **Simplified stability reward**: The values are also mostly negative, indicating a penalty for small angles and velocities. However, the mean value is relatively high (-3.56), which may lead to over-penalization. Reducing the penalty might help.
3. **Smoothness reward**: This component has positive and negative values, but most are negative. The magnitude is moderate (-0.5 to -1.5). This suggests that the agent should avoid high-speed actions to some extent.
4. **Obstacle avoidance reward**: All values are negative, indicating a penalty for not avoiding obstacles. The magnitude is relatively high (-0.8 to 1), suggesting that obstacle avoidance is an important aspect of the task.

Based on this analysis, I propose the following improvements:

**New Reward Function:**

```
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    # Distance-based reward: moderate to high incentive for movement to the right
    distance_reward = np.tanh(pos.x / 50.0) * 1.5
    
    # Simplified stability reward: reduce penalty for small angles and velocities (scaled)
    angle_stability_penalty = -np.abs(state[0]) ** 2 * 0.01  # Reduced penalty
    angular_velocity_stability_penalty = -np.abs(state[1]) ** 2 * 0.005  # Reduced penalty
    stability_reward = np.mean([angle_stability_penalty, angular_velocity_stability_penalty]) * 0.5
    
    # Smoothness reward: moderate to high penalty for high-speed actions (scaled)
    action_smoothness_penalty = -np.sum(np.abs(action)) / len(action) * 1.0  # Scaled penalty
    smoothness_reward = np.tanh(action_smoothness_penalty) * 0.8
    
    # Obstacle avoidance reward: encourage avoidance of obstacles with high magnitude (bounded)
    obstacle_avoidance_reward = -np.clip(np.min([l.fraction for l in self.lidar]), -1, 0.5)  # Bounded penalty
    
    # Total reward: a weighted sum with adjusted weights
    reward = (distance_reward * 0.4
              + stability_reward * 0.2
              + smoothness_reward * 0.3
              + obstacle_avoidance_reward * 0.15)
    
    individual_reward = {
        "distance_reward": distance_reward,
        "stability_reward": stability_reward,
        "smoothness_reward": smoothness_reward,
        "obstacle_avoidance_reward": obstacle_avoidance_reward,
    }
    
    return reward, individual_reward
```

The key changes are:

* Increased the magnitude of the distance-based reward to incentivize movement to the right.
* Reduced the penalty for small angles and velocities in the stability reward.
* Increased the penalty for high-speed actions in the smoothness reward.
* Bounded the obstacle avoidance reward to prevent extreme penalties.

These modifications aim to better align the reward function with the task goals, encouraging the agent to move towards the right, maintain stability, avoid obstacles, and exhibit smooth actions.
