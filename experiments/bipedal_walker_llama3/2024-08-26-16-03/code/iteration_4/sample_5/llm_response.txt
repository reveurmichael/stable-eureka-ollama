Based on the provided feedback, I will analyze each existing reward component and provide an improved reward function.

**Distance Reward**: The magnitude of this reward is quite high (-5.91 to -3.10). This might be overwhelming other components. Considering the goal of maximizing fitness score, let's scale it down.

**Stability Reward**: This component has a significant impact on the overall reward (around 0.05 to 0.02). However, since stability is not explicitly rewarded in the feedback, we should reduce its weight or consider rewriting this component.

**Smoothness Reward**: The magnitude of this penalty is moderate (-3.78 to -3.13), indicating that high-speed actions are somewhat penalized. This seems reasonable, but let's scale it down slightly to avoid overwhelming other components.

**Obstacle Avoidance Reward**: The magnitude of this reward is quite high (up to 0.8). This component seems important, so we should keep its weight relatively high.

Considering the feedback and the goals mentioned earlier:

1. Fitness score: We want to maximize the fitness score, which means maximizing positive rewards.
2. Positive reward components: Distance Reward, Obstacle Avoidance Reward
3. Negative reward components: Smoothness Penalty (reduced), Stability Penalty (reduced)

**Improved Reward Function Proposal**:
```python
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    # Distance-based reward: incentivize movement to the right with moderate magnitude
    distance_reward = np.tanh(pos.x / 100.0) * 0.2

    # Simplified stability reward: reduced penalty for small angles and velocities (scaled)
    angle_stability_penalty = -np.abs(state[0]) ** 2 * 0.005  # Reduced penalty
    angular_velocity_stability_penalty = -np.abs(state[1]) ** 2 * 0.002  # Reduced penalty
    stability_reward = np.mean([angle_stability_penalty, angular_velocity_stability_penalty])

    # Smoothness reward: moderate to high penalty for high-speed actions (scaled)
    action_smoothness_penalty = -np.sum(np.abs(action)) / len(action) * 0.1  # Scaled penalty
    smoothness_reward = np.tanh(action_smoothness_penalty)

    # Obstacle avoidance reward: encourage avoidance of obstacles with high magnitude (bounded)
    obstacle_avoidance_reward = -np.clip(np.min([l.fraction for l in self.lidar]), -1, 0.6)  # Bounded penalty

    # Total reward: a weighted sum with adjusted weights
    reward = (distance_reward * 0.4
              + stability_reward * 0.1
              + smoothness_reward * 0.05
              + obstacle_avoidance_reward * 0.45)
    
    individual_reward = {
        "distance_reward": distance_reward,
        "stability_reward": stability_reward,
        "smoothness_reward": smoothness_reward,
        "obstacle_avoidance_reward": obstacle_avoidance_reward,
    }
    
    return reward, individual_reward
```
This improved reward function aims to balance the importance of each component based on the provided feedback. The weights have been adjusted to prioritize fitness score maximization while maintaining a reasonable balance between distance-based rewards and penalties for stability, smoothness, and obstacle avoidance.
