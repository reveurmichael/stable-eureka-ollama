Based on the feedback you provided, I will analyze each existing reward component and propose an improved reward function.

**Reward Component Analysis**

1. **Distance-based Reward**: The values are mostly negative, indicating that the agent is being penalized for not moving to the right. This suggests that the distance-based reward should be increased in magnitude to encourage movement towards the goal.
2. **Simplified Stability Reward**: The penalty for small angles and velocities is reduced, which is a good sign. However, the stability reward values are still mostly negative, indicating that the agent is not stabilizing well. Increasing the magnitude of this reward component could help improve stability.
3. **Smoothness Reward**: The penalty for high-speed actions is moderate to high, but the smoothness reward values are mostly positive. This suggests that the agent is moving smoothly, and increasing the magnitude of this reward component could further encourage smooth movement.
4. **Obstacle Avoidance Reward**: The penalty for not avoiding obstacles is high, but the obstacle avoidance reward values are mostly negative. This suggests that the agent is not avoiding obstacles well, and decreasing the magnitude of this reward component could help improve obstacle avoidance.

**Improved Reward Function Proposal**

Based on my analysis, I propose an improved reward function that combines these components with adjusted weights:

```
def compute_reward(self, pos, action, state):
    # Distance-based reward: incentivize movement to the right with increased magnitude
    distance_reward = np.tanh(pos.x / 50.0) * 1.5
    
    # Simplified stability reward: increase penalty for small angles and velocities (scaled)
    angle_stability_penalty = -np.abs(state[0]) ** 2 * 0.1  # Increased penalty
    angular_velocity_stability_penalty = -np.abs(state[1]) ** 2 * 0.05  # Slightly increased penalty
    stability_reward = np.mean([angle_stability_penalty, angular_velocity_stability_penalty])
    
    # Smoothness reward: moderate to high penalty for high-speed actions (scaled)
    action_smoothness_penalty = -np.sum(np.abs(action)) / len(action) * 0.7  # Increased penalty
    smoothness_reward = np.tanh(action_smoothness_penalty)
    
    # Obstacle avoidance reward: decrease penalty for not avoiding obstacles (bounded)
    obstacle_avoidance_reward = -np.clip(np.min([l.fraction for l in self.lidar]), -0.5, 0)  # Decreased penalty
    
    # Total reward: a weighted sum with adjusted weights
    reward = (distance_reward * 0.4
              + stability_reward * 0.3
              + smoothness_reward * 0.2
              + obstacle_avoidance_reward * 0.1)
    
    individual_reward = {
        "distance_reward": distance_reward,
        "stability_reward": stability_reward,
        "smoothness_reward": smoothness_reward,
        "obstacle_avoidance_reward": obstacle_avoidance_reward,
    }
    
    return reward, individual_reward
```

This improved reward function aims to balance the four components and provide a more nuanced signal for the agent. The distance-based reward is increased in magnitude to encourage movement towards the goal, while the stability and smoothness rewards are increased slightly to promote better control. The obstacle avoidance penalty is decreased to make it less severe, as the agent should be able to avoid obstacles without being heavily penalized.
