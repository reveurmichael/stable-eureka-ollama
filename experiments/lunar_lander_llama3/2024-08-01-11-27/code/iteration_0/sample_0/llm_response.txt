A classic reinforcement learning problem!

The reward function I would suggest for this lunar lander task is a combination of rewards that encourage the agent to successfully land on the helipad while minimizing fuel consumption. Here's my proposal:

```python
def compute_reward(state, m_power, s_power, terminated):
    # Reward for landing on the helipad (1.0 if within 0.1m radius)
    landed = np.abs(state[0]) <= 0.1

    # Penalty for not being awake (i.e., the lander is stuck or crashed)
    asleep = not state[-1] and not state[-2]

    # Reward for fuel efficiency (negative reward for excessive m_power usage)
    fuel_efficiency = -m_power

    # Reward for side engines (proportional to s_power usage, but with a cap at 0.5)
    side_engine_usage = np.clip(s_power, 0, 0.5)

    if terminated:
        # Terminal reward: -1.0 if failed to land or crashed
        reward = -1.0
    else:
        # Non-terminal reward: sum of all rewards
        reward = landed * 1.0 + (not asleep) * 0.5 + fuel_efficiency * 0.2 + side_engine_usage * 0.3

    individual_reward = {
        'landed': landed,
        'asleep': asleep,
        'fuel_efficiency': fuel_efficiency,
        'side_engine_usage': side_engine_usage
    }

    return reward, individual_reward
```

This reward function encourages the agent to:

1. Land on the helipad (reward: 1.0 if within a certain radius).
2. Stay awake and avoid crashing or getting stuck (penalty: -1.0 if asleep).
3. Conserve fuel by using main engines efficiently (negative reward for excessive m_power usage, capped at 0.5).
4. Use side engines effectively while landing (reward proportional to s_power usage, capped at 0.5).

Feel free to adjust these weights and thresholds to better suit your specific problem requirements!
