I'd be happy to help you with that!

The reward function I've written for this reinforcement learning task is as follows:

```python
def compute_reward(self, state, m_power, s_power, terminated):
    if terminated:
        # If the game has ended or the lander has fallen off the screen, penalize the agent
        return -1.0, {'failure': 1.0}

    reward = 0

    # Encourage the agent to stay close to the center of the screen (i.e., the helipad)
    if state[0] < 0:
        reward -= 0.01 * abs(state[0])
    elif state[0] > 1.0:
        reward -= 0.01 * (state[0] - 1.0)

    # Encourage the agent to stay close to the center of the screen in the y-axis
    if state[1] < 0:
        reward -= 0.005 * abs(state[1])
    elif state[1] > 1.0:
        reward -= 0.005 * (state[1] - 1.0)

    # Encourage the agent to maintain a high z-velocity
    if vel.z < 0.5:
        reward += 0.02

    # Penalize the agent for using too much main engine power
    reward -= m_power * 0.01

    # Penalize the agent for using too much side engine power
    reward -= s_power * 0.005

    return reward, {'main_engine': -m_power, 'side_engine': -s_power}
```

This reward function aims to balance exploration-exploitation trade-offs by:

1.  Encouraging the agent to stay close to the center of the screen (i.e., the helipad) with a penalty for deviating too far.
2.  Fostering the development of high z-velocities using the main engines, which is beneficial for landing safely.
3.  Discouraging excessive use of both main and side engine powers to avoid wasting fuel.

These reward components are designed to work in concert to steer the agent towards successful landings while minimizing energy consumption.
