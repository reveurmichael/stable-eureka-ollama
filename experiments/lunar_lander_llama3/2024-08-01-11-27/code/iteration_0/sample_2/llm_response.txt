A reinforcement learning problem!

The goal of the reward function is to encourage the agent (lander) to successfully land on the helipad. Here's a possible implementation:
```python
def compute_reward(self, state, m_power, s_power, terminated):
    # Define some constants
    LANDING_BONUS = 10.0
    VELOCITY_PENALTY = -0.5
    ANGLE_PENALTY = -1.0

    # Calculate the distance to the helipad
    distance_to_helipad = abs(state[0]) + abs(state[1])

    # Check if the agent has landed successfully (distance to helipad < 0.1)
    if distance_to_helipad < 0.1:
        return LANDING_BONUS, {"landing_bonus": LANDING_BONUS}

    # Calculate the velocity penalty
    velocity_reward = VELOCITY_PENALTY * (state[2] ** 2 + state[3] ** 2)

    # Calculate the angle penalty
    angle_reward = ANGLE_PENALTY * abs(state[4])

    # Calculate the overall reward
    reward = velocity_reward + angle_reward

    if terminated:
        return -100.0, {"game_over": True}

    return reward, {"velocity_penalty": velocity_reward, "angle_penalty": angle_reward}
```
Here's a brief explanation of the reward function:

1. The agent receives a LANDING_BONUS (10.0) when it successfully lands on the helipad.
2. If the agent is still in mid-air, it incurs a VELOCITY_PENALTY (-0.5) based on its velocity ( quadratic penalty).
3. Additionally, an ANGLE_PENALTY (-1.0) is applied to encourage the agent to maintain a stable orientation.
4. If the episode terminates (e.g., due to the game being over or the lander falling), a large negative reward (-100.0) is given to discourage the agent from continuing in that state.

The individual rewards are also returned, which can be useful for debugging and analyzing the agent's behavior.
