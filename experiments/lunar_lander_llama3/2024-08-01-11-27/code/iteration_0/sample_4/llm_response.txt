A reinforcement learning problem! I'll help you design an effective reward function for this task.

The goal of the lander agent is to successfully land on the helipad while minimizing penalties. We can break down the reward into several components:

1. **Landing success**: If the lander reaches the helipad and all legs are in contact, a high positive reward should be given.
2. **Distance from helipad**: The closer the lander is to the helipad, the higher the reward. This encourages the agent to get as close as possible before landing.
3. **Altitude**: The lower the altitude, the higher the reward. This discourages the agent from hovering too high and instead encourages it to descend.
4. **Velocity**: A low velocity is preferred, as it indicates a controlled descent.

Here's a potential reward function:
```python
def compute_reward(state, m_power, s_power, terminated):
    reward = 0

    # Landing success (100 points if successful)
    if state[6] == 1 and state[7] == 1:  # All legs in contact on the helipad
        reward += 100.0

    # Distance from helipad (-10 points per meter away)
    distance = abs(state[1]) - LEG_DOWN / SCALE
    reward -= distance * 10.0

    # Altitude (5 points per meter lower than the helipad)
    altitude = self.helipad_y + LEG_DOWN / SCALE - state[1]
    reward += altitude * 5.0

    # Velocity (-2 points per unit of velocity)
    reward -= state[3] * 2.0

    if terminated:
        # Penality for not landing successfully
        reward -= 50.0

    return reward, {"landing_success": int(state[6] == 1 and state[7] == 1)}
```
This reward function encourages the agent to land successfully on the helipad while minimizing penalties for distance, altitude, and velocity. The individual_reward dictionary provides a breakdown of the rewards.

Feel free to adjust these values or add more components as needed to suit your specific requirements.
