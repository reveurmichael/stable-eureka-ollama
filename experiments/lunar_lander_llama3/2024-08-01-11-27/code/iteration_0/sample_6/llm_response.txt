A challenge!

After carefully reading the code and understanding the environment, I'll propose a reward function that encourages the agent to learn effective control policies.

**Reward Function**

Let's define the reward `R` as a combination of three components:

1. **Progress towards the goal**: Encourage the agent to move closer to the helipad (target).
2. **Control and stability**: Reward the agent for maintaining good control and stability, which is crucial for landing safely.
3. **Penalty for crashes**: Penalize the agent if it crashes or falls too far from the target.

Here's the reward function:

```python
def compute_reward(state, m_power, s_power, terminated):
    # Progress towards the goal (target)
    goal_distance = np.sqrt((state[0] - 0) ** 2 + (state[1] - self.helipad_y - LEG_DOWN / SCALE) ** 2)
    reward_goal = -goal_distance

    # Control and stability
    control_reward = 1.0 - abs(state[2]) / FPS - abs(state[3]) / FPS
    reward_control = np.clip(control_reward, 0, 1)

    # Penalty for crashes (distance from the target)
    crash_penalty = abs(state[0])
    if terminated:
        reward_crash = -crash_penalty
    else:
        reward_crash = 0

    # Combine rewards
    individual_reward = {
        'goal': reward_goal,
        'control': reward_control,
        'crash': reward_crash
    }
    total_reward = sum(individual_reward.values())
    return total_reward, individual_reward
```

**Notes**

* The `compute_fitness_score` function is not directly used in the reward calculation. I assume it's used for visualization or logging purposes.
* The `individual_reward` dictionary provides a breakdown of the rewards for each component (goal, control, and crash).

This reward function should encourage the agent to learn effective control policies that bring the lander close to the target while maintaining stability and avoiding crashes.

Let me know if you'd like me to adjust or modify this reward function!
