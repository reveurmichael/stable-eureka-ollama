Based on the provided information, I can infer that you are trying to write a reward function for reinforcement learning. The task seems to be related to controlling a lander spacecraft in a simulation.

From what I understand, the goal is to keep the lander safe and stable while landing it safely on the helipad. To achieve this, the agent needs to control the orientation of the engines using continuous actions (0-1) for main engines and discrete actions (0/1) for side engines.

Here's a possible implementation of the reward function:

```
def compute_reward(self, state, m_power, s_power, terminated):
    if terminated:
        if self.game_over:  # Lander crashed or went out of bounds
            return -10.0, {'crashed': True}
        else:  # Lander landed safely
            return 10.0, {'landed_safely': True}

    # Reward for staying close to the target (helipad)
    reward = np.tanh((state[0] + state[1]) / VIEWPORT_W) * 2.0

    # Penalize for deviating from the target
    penalty = np.abs(state[0]) + np.abs(state[1])

    return -penalty + reward, {'reward': reward}
```

In this code, the reward is calculated based on two factors:

* The distance of the lander to the target (helipad). A higher reward is given for staying close to the target.
* The penalty for deviating from the target. A higher penalty is given for moving away from the target.

The `compute_fitness_score` method seems to be used to calculate an additional score based on the state of the lander and its performance.
