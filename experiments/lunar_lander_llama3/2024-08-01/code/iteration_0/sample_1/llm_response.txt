I see you want me to write the reward function!

Based on the provided code, I'm assuming the goal of the lander is to reach a certain height and position while avoiding crashes. Here's my attempt at writing an effective reward function:

```
def compute_reward(self, state, m_power, s_power, terminated):
    # Define constants for reward shaping
    HIGHEST_HEIGHT = 1.0
    REWARD_PER_HEIGHT_UNIT = -0.05
    PUNISHMENT_PER_CRASH = -5.0
    PUNISHMENT_PER_DISTANCE_FROM_GOAL = -0.01

    height_reward = np.tanh(state[1] / HIGHEST_HEIGHT) * REWARD_PER_HEIGHT_UNIT
    crash_punishment = 0.0
    if terminated:
        crash_punishment = PUNISHMENT_PER_CRASH

    distance_from_goal = np.abs(state[0])
    distance_punishment = PUNISHMENT_PER_DISTANCE_FROM_GOAL * distance_from_goal

    reward = height_reward + distance_punishment - crash_punishment
    individual_reward = {
        'height_reward': height_reward,
        'crash_punishment': crash_punishment,
        'distance_punishment': distance_punishment,
    }
    return reward, individual_reward
```

This reward function aims to encourage the lander to:

1. Reach a certain height (punished if it doesn't reach the desired height).
2. Stay close to the goal position (punished if it's far away).
3. Avoid crashing (severely punished if it does crash).

The `np.tanh` function helps smooth out the reward curve for the height, while the `abs` function ensures the distance punishment is proportional to the distance from the goal.

Please note that this is just one possible implementation of a reward function. You may need to adjust or modify it based on your specific requirements and experimentation.
