Here's a possible implementation for the `compute_reward` function:

```
def compute_reward(self, state, m_power, s_power, terminated):
    reward = 0.0
    
    # Reward for being close to the target
    reward += -5 * (state[1] + self.helipad_y) ** 2
    
    # Punish for falling off the edge
    if abs(state[0]) >= 1.0:
        reward -= 100.0
    
    # Reward for moving forward (up in y direction)
    reward += state[3]
    
    # Punish for using main engines (try to use side engines instead)
    reward -= m_power * 10.0
    
    if terminated:
        # If the episode is over, give a small bonus for being close to the target
        if abs(state[1] + self.helipad_y) < 0.1:
            reward += 100.0
    
    return reward, {'main_engines': m_power * 10.0, 'side_engines': s_power}
```

This reward function provides a combination of positive and negative incentives to guide the agent towards solving the task. The main goals are:

1. Reach the target: A penalty term is used to encourage the agent to move closer to the target.
2. Stay on the platform: If the agent falls off the edge, it receives a large penalty.
3. Move forward (up in y direction): A reward term is used to incentivize movement in the upward direction.
4. Use side engines efficiently: The use of main engines is penalized to encourage the use of side engines instead.

The function also keeps track of the individual rewards for main and side engines, which can be useful for debugging or analyzing the agent's behavior.
