The reward function! This is where the magic happens. As a reward engineer, I'll create an effective reward function that encourages the agent to learn and achieve its goals.

Here's my take on the reward function:
```python
def compute_reward(state, m_power, s_power, terminated):
    # Define the reward structure
    reward = 0.0

    # Reward for reaching the helipad ( termination state )
    if terminated:
        if abs(state[0]) >= 1.0:  # Land successfully on the helipad
            reward += 10.0
        else:  # Fail to land
            reward -= 5.0

    # Reward for orientation and side engines
    if m_power > 0:
        reward += 2.0 * m_power  # Main engine power
    if s_power > 0:
        reward += 1.0 * s_power  # Side engine power

    # Penalty for not reaching the helipad ( termination state )
    if not terminated and abs(state[0]) < 1.0:  # Still in flight
        reward -= 0.5  # Gradually decrease reward as agent doesn't land

    return reward, individual_reward
```
Here's a breakdown of the reward structure:

* **Termination state**: If the agent successfully lands on the helipad (abs(state[0]) >= 1.0), it receives a high reward (10.0). Otherwise, if it fails to land, it gets a low penalty (-5.0).
* **Orientation and side engines**: The agent receives rewards for using its main (m_power) and side (s_power) engines effectively.
* **Penalty for not reaching the helipad**: If the agent is still in flight and hasn't landed (abs(state[0]) < 1.0), it gradually loses reward (-0.5 per iteration).

This reward function encourages the agent to learn a balance between using its main and side engines, while also striving to land safely on the helipad.

What do you think? Do you have any suggestions or modifications in mind?
