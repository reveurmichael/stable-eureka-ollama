A reinforcement learning problem!

The reward function should encourage the agent to achieve a good score. Based on the provided code, I'm going to assume that the goal is to land the lander safely and efficiently.

Here's a possible reward function:
```python
def compute_reward(self, state, m_power, s_power, terminated):
    if terminated:
        return -10.0  # penalize termination
    elif abs(state[0]) >= 1.0:  # outside the viewport
        return -5.0
    else:  # good score!
        return 1.0 + m_power + s_power  # bonus for main and side engines
```
Here's a breakdown of the reward function:

* If the episode is terminated (e.g., the lander crashes or falls off the screen), we penalize the agent with a -10.0 reward.
* If the lander is outside the viewport (i.e., `abs(state[0]) >= 1.0`), we penalize it with a -5.0 reward to encourage the agent to stay within the bounds.
* Otherwise, we give the agent a positive reward that depends on its performance:
	+ We add +1.0 for each successful landing (i.e., staying within the viewport).
	+ We add `m_power` and `s_power` as bonuses for using the main and side engines effectively.

Feel free to adjust this reward function to suit your specific needs!
