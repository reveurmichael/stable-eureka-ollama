A reinforcement learning problem!

Based on the provided code, I'll assume that the reward function should encourage the agent to successfully land the spacecraft. Here's a possible reward function:

```python
def compute_reward(state, m_power, s_power, terminated):
    # Define a set of terminal states (e.g., crash, successful landing)
    TERMINAL_STATES = [
        state[0] >= 1.0,  # off-screen x-position
        abs(state[1]) >= VIEWPORT_H / SCALE / 2,  # off-screen y-position
        self.lander.angle > 10.0 or self.lander.angle < -10.0  # excessive rotation
    ]

    if terminated:
        # Punish the agent for not achieving a successful landing
        reward = -1.0
    else:
        # Reward the agent for being close to the helipad and having reasonable velocity
        distance_to_helipad = np.hypot(state[0], state[1] - self.helipad_y)
        if distance_to_helipad < 10.0:  # within a certain radius of the helipad
            reward = 1.0
        else:
            reward = -0.1

    individual_reward = {
        'distance_to_helipad': distance_to_helipad,
        'reward': reward
    }

    return reward, individual_reward
```

This reward function is designed to:

1. Encourage the agent to stay close to the helipad (positive reward when within a certain radius).
2. Punish the agent for not achieving a successful landing (negative reward if terminated).
3. Provide a moderate penalty for being far from the helipad or having excessive rotation.

Feel free to adjust and refine this reward function based on your specific problem requirements!
