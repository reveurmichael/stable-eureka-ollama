As a reward engineer, I would write the following reward function based on the provided environment and problem statement:

```
def compute_reward(self, state, m_power, s_power, terminated):
    # Define constants for the reward shaping
    LANDING_REWARD = 0.1
    CRASH_PENALTY = -0.5
    FUEL_PENALTY = -0.01

    # Compute rewards based on the current state and actions taken
    reward = 0.0
    if terminated:
        if self.game_over:  # Crashed or fell off the helicopter pad
            reward += CRASH_PENALTY
        else:  # Successfully landed
            reward += LANDING_REWARD
    elif abs(state[0]) >= 1.0:  # Off-screen left or right
        reward += -CRASH_PENALTY

    if m_power > 0:
        reward -= FUEL_PENALTY * m_power
    if s_power > 0:
        reward -= FUEL_PENALTY * s_power

    return reward, {'main_engine': m_power, 'side_engines': s_power}
```

This reward function rewards the agent for successfully landing and penalizes it for crashing or falling off the helicopter pad. It also incorporates fuel consumption by reducing the reward based on the main and side engine powers. The `compute_fitness_score` method is not provided in the given code, so I assume it would be used to compute a secondary fitness score that could be used to evaluate the agent's performance.

This reward function is designed to promote successful landings while also encouraging fuel efficiency and reasonable use of both main and side engines.
