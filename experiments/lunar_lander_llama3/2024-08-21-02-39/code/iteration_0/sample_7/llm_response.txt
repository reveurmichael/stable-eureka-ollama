A reinforcement learning problem!

The goal of the reward function is to encourage the agent (lander) to navigate and land safely on the helipad. Here's a possible implementation:

```
def compute_reward(self, state, m_power, s_power, terminated):
    # Define the reward structure
    reward = 0.0

    # Bonus for landing safely (on the helipad)
    if terminated and abs(state[0]) < 1.0:  # landed successfully
        reward += 10.0  # high reward for a safe landing
    elif not terminated:  # still in the air
        reward -= 0.1  # slight penalty for not landing yet

    # Penalty for crashing (out of bounds or too far from helipad)
    if abs(state[0]) >= 1.0:  # crashed out of bounds
        reward -= 10.0  # harsh penalty for a crash
    elif state[2] > FPS * 5:  # flying too high, not close to the helipad
        reward -= 1.0  # mild penalty for not approaching the helipad

    return reward, {'m_power': m_power, 's_power': s_power}
```

In this implementation:

* A safe landing (on the helipad) earns a high reward of 10.0.
* Not landing yet incurs a slight penalty of -0.1.
* Crashing out of bounds or flying too far from the helipad results in a harsh penalty of -10.0.
* The individual rewards for main and side engines (`m_power` and `s_power`) are also returned as part of the reward dictionary.

This is just one possible approach, and you can adjust the reward structure to better fit your specific problem requirements.
