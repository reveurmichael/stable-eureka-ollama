A reinforcement learning problem!

The reward function is implemented in the `compute_reward` method. Here's what I can see:

```
def compute_reward(self, state, m_power, s_power, terminated):
    # ... some calculation ...
    if not self.lander.awake:
        return 0.0
    if abs(state[0]) >= 1.0:  # x position out of bounds?
        return -100.0
    if self.game_over:  # game over?
        return -200.0
    # ... some more calculation ...
    return individual_reward + penalty_term
```

In summary, the reward function seems to be designed to encourage the agent to:

1. Keep the lander awake.
2. Stay within a certain range of the x-axis (i.e., don't fall off the screen).
3. Not crash or run out of fuel.

The reward is `-100` if the lander falls off the screen, `-200` if the game is over, and 0 otherwise. The `individual_reward` seems to be a separate term that's added to the final reward.

Please let me know if I'm missing anything or if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these points!
