A challenge!

After analyzing the code, I'll provide my interpretation of the reward function. Please note that this may not be the exact original intention of the developers.

The reward function seems to be composed of two parts:

1. `compute_reward(state, m_power, s_power, terminated)`:
	* This function takes in the current state, main engine power (`m_power`), side engine power (`s_power`), and a termination flag (`terminated`). It returns a reward value.
2. The second part is not explicitly shown, but it seems to be related to `compute_fitness_score(state, m_power, s_power, terminated)`. This function also takes in the same inputs as the first part and returns a fitness score.

The overall reward structure appears to be designed to encourage the agent to:

* Move the lander towards the helipad (positive rewards for proximity)
* Maintain a stable orientation (perhaps through side engine control)
* Avoid termination conditions (e.g., game over, off-screen, or non-grounded legs)

In more detail, the reward function might incorporate terms such as:

* Proximity to the helipad: `reward += some_value * (1 - abs(state[0]))` (closer to 1 is better)
* Orientation stability: `reward += some_value * (1 - abs(state[5]))` (smaller angular velocity is better)
* Termination avoidance: `reward -= penalty_value if terminated else reward`

These are just my interpretations based on the code. The actual reward function might be more complex or nuanced.

Please let me know if I'm correct or if there's more to the story!
