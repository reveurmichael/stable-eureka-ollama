Based on the provided code, I can see that the reward function is defined in the `compute_reward` method. Here's the relevant part of the code:
```python
def compute_reward(self, state, m_power, s_power, terminated):
    # TO DO: implement a suitable reward function
    return 0, {}
```
The reward function should take into account the state of the environment, the actions taken by the agent (m_power and s_power), and whether the episode is terminated or not. The goal is to design a reward function that encourages the agent to learn the desired behavior.

Some possible approaches to designing the reward function include:

1. **Sparse rewards**: Provide a reward only when a specific event occurs, such as landing safely on the helipad.
2. **Continuous rewards**: Provide a reward based on how close the agent is to achieving its goals, such as staying near the center of the screen or maintaining a certain velocity.
3. **Penalty-based rewards**: Penalize the agent for taking actions that are undesirable, such as crashing into the ground or falling off the helipad.

The `compute_reward` method returns a tuple `(reward, individual_reward)`. The `reward` value is a scalar reward signal that will be used by the reinforcement learning algorithm to update the agent's policy. The `individual_reward` dictionary can be used to provide additional information about the agent's performance, such as its fitness score.

I'll leave it up to you to decide how to implement the reward function!
