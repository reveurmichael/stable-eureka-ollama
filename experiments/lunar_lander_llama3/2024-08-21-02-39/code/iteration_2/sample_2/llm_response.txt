A reinforcement learning problem!

After carefully examining the provided code, I can see that the reward function is defined in the `compute_reward` method. This method takes the current state, main engine power (`m_power`), side engine power (`s_power`), and a boolean indicating whether the episode has terminated (`terminated`) as input.

The reward calculation involves two parts: individual rewards and overall reward. The `individual_reward` is updated with the fitness score, which seems to be a separate metric used for evaluation.

Here's the relevant code snippet:
```python
reward, individual_reward = self.compute_reward(state, m_power, s_power, terminated)

if self.render_mode == "human":
    self.render()

fitness_score = self.compute_fitness_score(state, m_power, s_power, terminated)
individual_reward.update({'fitness_score': fitness_score})

return np.array(state, dtype=np.float32), reward, terminated, False, individual_reward
```
Unfortunately, the actual implementation of the `compute_reward` and `compute_fitness_score` methods is not provided. However, based on the context, I can make some educated guesses about what these functions might be doing.

**Guess 1: `compute_reward`**

The reward function might encourage the agent to:

* Maintain a stable position near the helipad (e.g., penalize large deviations from the target location)
* Use the main engine efficiently (e.g., reward low fuel consumption)
* Utilize side engines wisely (e.g., reward smooth orientation changes)

**Guess 2: `compute_fitness_score`**

The fitness score function might evaluate the agent's performance based on:

* Landing accuracy (e.g., proximity to the target location)
* Fuel efficiency
* Orientation stability

Please note that these are just educated guesses, and the actual implementation of the reward and fitness score functions may differ. If you'd like me to help with designing or implementing a specific reward function, feel free to provide more context or clarify your goals!
