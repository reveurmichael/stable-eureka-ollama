Based on the provided code, the reward function appears to be implemented in the `compute_reward` method. The reward calculation seems to depend on the state of the environment (i.e., the lander's position, velocity, angle, and angular velocity) as well as the actions taken by the agent (i.e., the main engine power (`m_power`) and side engine power (`s_power`)).

The reward function is likely designed to encourage the agent to reach the helipad while avoiding crashing or running out of fuel. Here's a possible reflection on the reward code:

```
def compute_reward(self, state, m_power, s_power, terminated):
    # Calculate the distance from the lander to the helipad
    dist_to_helipad = np.sqrt((state[0] * VIEWPORT_W / SCALE + self.helipad_x) ** 2 +
                               (state[1] * VIEWPORT_H / SCALE + self.helipad_y) ** 2)

    # Reward the agent for reaching the helipad
    if dist_to_helipad < 0.5:
        reward = 10.0

    # Penalty for crashing or running out of fuel
    elif terminated:
        reward = -10.0

    # Encourage main engine usage and discourage side engines
    else:
        reward = (1.0 - np.abs(state[3])) * m_power - s_power

    return reward, individual_reward
```

This is a simplified example of the reward function, but it should give you an idea of how the reward calculation might be structured based on the provided code.
