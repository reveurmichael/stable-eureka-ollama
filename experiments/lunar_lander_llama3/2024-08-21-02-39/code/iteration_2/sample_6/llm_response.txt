A reinforcement learning problem!

The reward function appears to be defined in the `compute_reward` method. The signature of this method suggests that it takes the current state (`state`) and two actions (`m_power` and `s_power`) as input, and returns a scalar reward value.

Here's the relevant code snippet:
```python
def compute_reward(self, state, m_power, s_power, terminated):
    # ... (some logic here) ...
    return 0.0, {}
```
Unfortunately, the implementation of the reward function is not provided in this snippet, as it's a separate method that's not shown.

However, based on the context and the problem setup, we can infer some possible aspects of the reward function:

1. **Landing**: The agent is likely rewarded for successfully landing on the helipad.
2. **Distance to target**: The distance from the lander to the helipad might be a factor in the reward calculation.
3. **Velocity and orientation**: The agent's velocity and orientation might influence the reward, with faster and more controlled movements receiving higher rewards.
4. **Penalties for crashes or straying too far**: If the lander crashes or strays too far from the helipad, the agent might receive a penalty or a low reward.

The exact reward function will depend on the specific design goals of the problem, but these aspects provide some hints about what the reward might be trying to encourage.
