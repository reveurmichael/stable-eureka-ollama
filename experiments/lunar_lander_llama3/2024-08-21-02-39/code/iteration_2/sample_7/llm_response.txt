A reinforcement learning problem!

The reward function is:
```
def compute_reward(self, state, m_power, s_power, terminated):
    ...
```
It takes in the current state of the environment (`state`), the main engine power (`m_power`) and side engine power (`s_power`) as inputs, and returns a reward value and an individual reward dictionary. The `terminated` flag indicates whether the episode has ended.

The implementation of this function is not provided, but it's likely to involve calculating a reward based on the agent's progress towards its goals (e.g., landing safely) and penalizing undesirable behaviors (e.g., falling too far or not moving).

In the context of the Lunar Lander problem, the reward function might aim to encourage the agent to:

1. Land safely: A positive reward for being close to the helipad without crashing.
2. Move efficiently: A reward for applying reasonable main engine thrust and side engine corrections.
3. Avoid excessive main engine use: A penalty for using too much main engine power, as this can lead to a crash or waste of energy.
4. Maintain stable orientation: A small positive reward for keeping the lander's orientation close to vertical.

The individual reward dictionary likely contains additional information about the agent's performance, such as:

* `fitness_score`: A score reflecting the agent's overall fitness (e.g., based on its ability to land safely and efficiently).
* Other relevant metrics, like the distance from the helipad or the number of engine corrections made.

The exact implementation of the reward function depends on the specific design goals and constraints of the problem.
