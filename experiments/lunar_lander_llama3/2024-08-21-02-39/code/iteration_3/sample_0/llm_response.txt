Based on the provided code, I can see that the reward function is implemented in the `compute_reward` method. Here's a breakdown of what I found:

```python
def compute_reward(self, state, m_power, s_power, terminated):
    # Calculate reward based on the current state and actions taken
    if self.lander.position[0] >= 1.0:
        return 1.0, {'success': True}
    elif abs(state[0]) > 0.5 or abs(state[1]) > 0.2:
        return -1.0, {'crash': True}
    else:
        return 0.01, {}
```

In this reward function, the agent receives a positive reward of `1.0` if it successfully lands on the helipad (i.e., its x-position is greater than or equal to `1.0`). A negative reward of `-1.0` is given if the lander crashes or falls off the platform.

If neither of these conditions is met, a small positive reward of `0.01` is given as a general encouragement to continue exploring and learning.

The reward function also returns a dictionary with additional information about the episode. For example, if the agent successfully landed on the helipad, the dictionary might contain a key-value pair like `{success: True}`.

Overall, this reward function provides a simple yet effective way to guide the agent's behavior towards achieving its goal (i.e., landing safely on the helipad).
