A reinforcement learning problem!

From the provided code, I can infer that your reward function is defined in the `compute_reward` method. Here's a possible reflection of your reward code:
```python
def compute_reward(self, state, m_power, s_power, terminated):
    # Reward structure: -1 for crash, +0.1 for being close to helipad, +0.01 for every unit of x-distance from helipad,
    #                   -0.001 for every unit of y-distance from helipad
    reward = 0.0

    if terminated:
        # Game over or landed too far away, penalize heavily
        reward -= 1.0
    elif abs(state[0]) >= 1.0:  # x-distance from helipad
        # Reward for being close to helipad
        reward += 0.1 * (1.0 - abs(state[0]))
    else:
        # Reward for every unit of x-distance from helipad
        reward += 0.01 * state[0]
    if state[3] < 0:  # y-velocity is negative, implying the lander is moving up
        # Penalize for upward motion (trying to lift off)
        reward -= 0.001 * state[3]
    return reward, individual_reward
```
Please note that this is an educated guess based on the provided code. The actual reward function might be different or more complex.

In general, a well-designed reward function should encourage desired behavior while avoiding undesired behavior. In this case, it seems to prioritize landing close to the helipad and penalize crashes or excessive upward motion.
