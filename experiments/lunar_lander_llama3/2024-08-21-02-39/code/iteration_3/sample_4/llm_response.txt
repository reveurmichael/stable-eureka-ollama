The reward function! It's the heart of reinforcement learning. In this case, it seems like you have a custom reward function for the Lunar Lander problem.

From what I can see, your reward function is defined within `compute_reward` method. Here's how it looks:
```python
reward, individual_reward = self.compute_reward(state, m_power, s_power, terminated)
```
And then, in the `compute_reward` method, you have some custom logic to calculate the reward based on the state, `m_power`, `s_power`, and whether the episode is terminated.

Here's what I can infer from the code:

1. The reward function takes into account the state of the environment (e.g., lander position, velocity, angle, and angular velocity).
2. It also considers the magnitude of the main engine power (`m_power`) and side engines power (`s_power`).
3. If the episode is terminated, the reward might be adjusted or set to a specific value.
4. The `individual_reward` dictionary seems to store additional information about the episode, such as the fitness score.

Without seeing the implementation of `compute_reward`, it's hard for me to provide more insight. However, I'm curious - what kind of reward schedule do you have in mind? Is it based on achieving a specific goal (e.g., landing safely), or is it more focused on encouraging exploration and learning?
