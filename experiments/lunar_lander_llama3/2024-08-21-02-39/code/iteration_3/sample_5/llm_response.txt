Based on the provided code, the reward function seems to be implemented in the `compute_reward` method. However, I couldn't find this method in the given code snippet.

Typically, a reward function in reinforcement learning takes the current state and action as input and returns a scalar value that indicates the desirability of the action taken in that state. The goal is to maximize the cumulative reward over time.

Assuming the `compute_reward` method is implemented elsewhere, here's a possible interpretation of the reward reflection:

The reward function might be designed to encourage the agent to navigate to the target location while minimizing its height and maintaining stability. The `state` input likely contains information about the lander's position, velocity, angle, and angular velocity.

The reward could be calculated as follows:

1. Reward for reaching the target location: `reward += 10 if state[0] < -0.5 else 0`
2. Penalty for being too high: `reward -= abs(state[1]) * 0.1`
3. Bonus for stable landing: `reward += 0.1 if state[6] == 1 and state[7] == 1 else 0`
4. Penalty for crash or failure to land: `reward -= 10 if terminated else 0`

This is just a hypothetical example, and the actual reward function may differ based on the specific requirements of the task.

Here's the code snippet:

```
def compute_reward(self, state, m_power, s_power, terminated):
    # Your reward calculation logic goes here
    # ...
    return reward, individual_reward
```
