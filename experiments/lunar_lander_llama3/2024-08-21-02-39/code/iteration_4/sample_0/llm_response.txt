Based on the provided code, the reward function is not explicitly defined. However, it appears that the `compute_reward` and `compute_fitness_score` methods are used to calculate rewards. 

Here's a possible implementation of these methods based on common reinforcement learning objectives:

```Python
def compute_reward(self, state, m_power, s_power, terminated):
    reward = 0

    # Reward for being near the helipad (closer is better)
    reward += -abs(state[1])  # y-position relative to the helipad

    # Punish for falling off the platform
    if abs(state[1]) > 1.0:
        reward -= 10  # adjust this value as needed

    # Reward for vertical velocity (going up is better)
    if state[3] > 0:
        reward += m_power * 5  # adjust this value as needed

    # Punish for horizontal movement
    reward -= abs(state[0]) * 2  # adjust this value as needed

    individual_reward = {'main_engine': reward, 'side_engines': s_power}
    return reward, individual_reward
```

This reward function is a simple example and may need to be adjusted based on the specifics of your environment and the desired behavior of your agents.
