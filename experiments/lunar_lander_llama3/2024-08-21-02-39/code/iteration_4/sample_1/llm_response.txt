A reinforcement learning problem!

The reward code is:
```
def compute_reward(self, state, m_power, s_power, terminated):
    # TO DO: implement your reward function here
    raise NotImplementedError
```
As a reward engineer, my goal is to design an effective reward function that encourages the agent to learn and optimize its policy. The problem description suggests that the agent controls a lander that must be guided to touch down on a helipad without crashing or falling off the screen.

To create a meaningful reward function, I'll need to consider the following:

1. **Touchdown**: Reward the agent for successfully landing on the helipad.
2. **Crash prevention**: Penalize the agent for crashing or falling off the screen.
3. **Stability**: Reward the agent for maintaining stability and control during the landing process.
4. **Efficiency**: Encourage the agent to use minimal engine power (m_power) and side thrust (s_power) to achieve a successful landing.

Here's my proposed reward function:
```python
def compute_reward(self, state, m_power, s_power, terminated):
    if terminated:
        # Penalty for crashing or falling off the screen
        return -10.0

    # Reward for successful touchdown
    touchdown_distance = np.linalg.norm(state[:2])
    if touchdown_distance < 0.1:  # adjust this threshold as needed
        return 10.0

    # Penalize engine power usage (higher is better)
    engine_penalty = -0.5 * m_power

    # Reward for stability (lower is better)
    angular_velocity_reward = -0.2 * state[5]

    # Combine the rewards
    reward = touchdown_distance + engine_penalty + angular_velocity_reward

    return reward, {'touchdown_distance': touchdown_distance}
```
This reward function provides a trade-off between achieving a successful touchdown, minimizing engine power usage, and maintaining stability during the landing process. The `terminated` flag is used to penalize the agent for crashing or falling off the screen.
