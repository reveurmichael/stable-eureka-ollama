Based on the provided code, it appears that the reward function is implemented in the `compute_reward` method. Here's a possible reflection of the reward code:
```
def compute_reward(self, state, m_power, s_power, terminated):
    # Compute reward based on state and actions
    if terminated:
        return -1.0, {}  # Game over or simulation terminated; reward is negative

    # Check if lander has reached the helipad
    if abs(state[0]) < 0.5:  # Lander within a certain distance from the helipad
        return 10.0, {'helipad_reached': True}

    # Reward for maintaining altitude and position
    reward = -1.0 * (state[2]**2 + state[3]**2)  # Penalize velocity

    if s_power > 0:  # Side engines are active
        reward += 5.0 * s_power  # Reward for using side engines

    if m_power > 0:  # Main engine is active
        reward -= 10.0 * m_power  # Penalty for using main engine

    return reward, {'altitude': state[1], 'velocity_x': state[2], 'velocity_y': state[3]}
```
Note that this is just a possible implementation of the reward function based on the provided code. The actual reward function may be different, depending on the specific requirements and constraints of the problem.
