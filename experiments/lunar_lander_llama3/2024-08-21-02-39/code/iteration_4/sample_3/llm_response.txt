A reinforcement learning problem!

The reward function is defined in the `compute_reward` method. Here's what I can infer from the provided code:
```python
def compute_reward(self, state, m_power, s_power, terminated):
    # Compute individual rewards for main and side engines
    main_engine_reward = -0.1 * np.abs(m_power)  # penalty for using main engine
    side_engine_reward = -0.05 * np.abs(s_power)  # penalty for using side engines

    if terminated:
        reward = -10.0  # strong penalty when the episode is terminated
    else:
        reward = main_engine_reward + side_engine_reward  # sum individual rewards

    return reward, individual_reward
```
The reward function consists of two components:

1. **Main engine reward**: a penalty term that decreases linearly with the magnitude of the main engine power (`m_power`). This encourages the agent to use the main engine sparingly.
2. **Side engine reward**: another penalty term that decreases linearly with the magnitude of the side engine power (`s_power`). This also encourages the agent to use the side engines judiciously.

When the episode is terminated (e.g., the lander crashes or falls off the helipad), a strong penalty of `-10.0` is applied. Otherwise, the individual rewards are summed to determine the overall reward for that step.

The `individual_reward` dictionary updates with the `fitness_score`, which might be used to compute additional metrics or visualize the agent's performance.
