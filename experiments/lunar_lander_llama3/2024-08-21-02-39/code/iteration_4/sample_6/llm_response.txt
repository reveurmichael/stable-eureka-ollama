The reward code is not provided in the given snippet. However, it's common for reward functions to be designed based on the specific goals of the reinforcement learning task.

For example, the goal might be to maximize the distance from the helipad or minimize the time taken to reach a certain height. The reward function could be something like:

```
def compute_reward(state, m_power, s_power, terminated):
    if not terminated:
        # Reward for moving forward
        reward = state[0]  # or some other function of position

        # Penalty for orientation and legs on the ground
        reward -= abs(state[4])  # or some other function of angle
        reward -= state[6] + state[7]

        return reward, {'main': reward, 'orientation': -abs(state[4]), 'legs': -(state[6] + state[7])}
    else:
        return 0.0, {}
```

This is just an example and the actual reward function would depend on the specific requirements of your task.
