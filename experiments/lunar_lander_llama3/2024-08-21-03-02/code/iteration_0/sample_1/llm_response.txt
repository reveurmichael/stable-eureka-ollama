Based on the provided environment and the specific task of landing a lander safely, I will design a reward function that encourages the agent to reach the helipad while avoiding collisions and keeping the lander stable.

The reward function should have the following components:

1. **Distance to Helipad**: Encourage the agent to move closer to the helipad by providing a positive reward for decreasing distance.
2. **Lander Stability**: Reward the agent for maintaining a stable orientation (i.e., small angle) and velocity (i.e., low linear velocity).
3. **Collision Avoidance**: Penalize the agent for colliding with the ground or other objects by providing a negative reward when the lander's legs are in contact with the ground.
4. **Reward for Landing**: Provide a high reward when the lander successfully lands on the helipad.

Here is the reward function:

```python
def compute_reward(state, m_power, s_power, terminated):
    # Distance to Helipad
    distance_to_helipad = np.sqrt((state[0] + VIEWPORT_W / SCALE / 2) ** 2 + (state[1] - self.helipad_y - LEG_DOWN / SCALE) ** 2)
    reward_distance = -distance_to_helipad

    # Lander Stability
    stability_reward = -np.abs(state[4])  # penalize large angle deviations

    # Collision Avoidance
    if state[-1] + state[-2]:  # at least one leg is in contact with the ground
        collision_penalty = -0.5
    else:
        collision_penalty = 0

    # Reward for Landing
    if terminated and abs(state[0]) < 0.05:  # successful landing
        reward_landing = 10
    else:
        reward_landing = 0

    individual_reward = m_power * reward_distance + s_power * stability_reward + collision_penalty + reward_landing

    return individual_reward, {'distance_to_helipad': reward_distance, 'stability_reward': stability_reward, 'collision_penalty': collision_penalty, 'reward_landing': reward_landing}
```

This reward function is designed to encourage the agent to land safely and efficiently by providing a balance between distance to the helipad, lander stability, collision avoidance, and rewards for successful landing.
