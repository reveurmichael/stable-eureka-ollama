A reinforcement learning problem!

The goal is to design a reward function that encourages the agent (lander) to successfully land on the helipad. Here's a possible implementation:
```python
def compute_reward(state, m_power, s_power, terminated):
    # Define reward components
    distance_to_helipad = 1 - state[0]  # closer is better
    velocity = state[2]**2 + state[3]**2  # lower velocity is better
    angle_error = np.abs(state[4])  # smaller angle error is better
    legs_contact = int((state[6] + state[7])) / 2  # more contacts is better

    # Calculate reward
    if terminated:
        # Game over, penalize the agent
        reward = -10.0
    else:
        # Reward components
        distance_reward = distance_to_helipad * 5.0
        velocity_reward = np.exp(-velocity) * 2.0
        angle_reward = np.exp(-angle_error) * 1.0
        legs_reward = legs_contact * 3.0

        # Combine rewards
        reward = distance_reward + velocity_reward + angle_reward + legs_reward

    individual_reward = {
        'distance': distance_reward,
        'velocity': velocity_reward,
        'angle': angle_reward,
        'legs': legs_reward
    }
    return reward, individual_reward
```
Here's a breakdown of the reward components:

1. **Distance to helipad**: Encourages the agent to get closer to the helipad.
2. **Velocity**: Punishes high velocities by reducing the reward as velocity increases (using an exponential decay).
3. **Angle error**: Rewards smaller angle errors between the lander's orientation and the desired upright position.
4. **Legs contact**: Encourages more leg contacts with the ground, indicating a stable landing.

The `compute_reward` function takes in the current state, motor power (`m_power`), side engine power (`s_power`), and a boolean indicating whether the episode is terminated (`terminated`). It returns a scalar reward value and an individual reward dictionary, which can be used to analyze the agent's performance.
