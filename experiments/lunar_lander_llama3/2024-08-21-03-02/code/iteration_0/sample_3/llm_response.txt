A reinforcement learning problem!

I'll write a simple yet effective reward function for this lunar lander task. The goal is to guide the agent towards achieving a high score while avoiding penalties.

Here's my proposal:

```
def compute_reward(self, state, m_power, s_power, terminated):
    # Define constants
    LANDING_BONUS = 10.0
    SURVIVAL_BONUS = 1.0
    PENALTY_PER_METER = -0.5
    PENALTY_PER_DEGREE = -0.2

    # Calculate reward based on state
    reward = 0.0
    if terminated:
        if abs(state[0]) < 0.1:  # Landed within the safe zone
            reward += LANDING_BONUS
        else:
            reward -= PENALTY_PER_METER * abs(state[0])
        if state[4] < 10.0:  # Angle is reasonable
            reward += SURVIVAL_BONUS
        else:
            reward -= PENALTY_PER_DEGREE * (state[4] - 10.0)
    else:
        reward = SURVIVAL_BONUS

    return reward, {'m_power': m_power, 's_power': s_power}
```

This reward function encourages the agent to:

1. Land safely within a reasonable distance from the center of the landing pad (LANDING_BONUS).
2. Survive for as long as possible without crashing or going too far off-center (SURVIVAL_BONUS).
3. Maintain a reasonable angle during descent (PENALTY_PER_DEGREE).

The reward is calculated based on the state, which includes the lander's position, velocity, and orientation. If the episode has terminated, the reward is adjusted accordingly.

This simple reward function should guide the agent towards achieving a high score while avoiding penalties for poor performance. Of course, you can always adjust or add to this reward function as needed to better suit your specific reinforcement learning task!
