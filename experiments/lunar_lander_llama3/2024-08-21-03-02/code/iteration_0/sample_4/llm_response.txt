Based on the provided code, I will design a suitable reward function for this reinforcement learning task. The goal of the reward function is to encourage the agent to learn the optimal policy that maximizes the score while keeping the lander stable.

The reward function can be designed as follows:

```
def compute_reward(self, state, m_power, s_power, terminated):
    # Define the constants for the reward
    LANDING_BONUS = 100.0
    STABLE_LANDER_BONUS = 10.0
    DISTANCE_PENALTY = -1.0
    VELOCITY_PENALTY = -0.5

    # Check if the lander has landed
    if terminated:
        if state[0] < -0.8:  # Lander is below the ground level
            return -LANDING_BONUS, {'landed': True}
        else:
            return LANDING_BONUS, {'landed': False}

    # Check if the lander is stable
    if np.abs(state[4]) < 5.0 and np.abs(state[5]) < 10.0:  # Lander angle and angular velocity are within a certain range
        reward = STABLE_LANDER_BONUS
    else:
        reward = -STABLE_LANDER_BONUS

    # Apply distance penalty
    reward += DISTANCE_PENALTY * (state[0] + VIEWPORT_W / SCALE / 2)

    # Apply velocity penalty
    reward += VELOCITY_PENALTY * np.abs(state[3])

    return reward, {'stable': abs(state[4]) < 5.0, 'landed': terminated}
```

This reward function provides a combination of positive and negative rewards to guide the agent's learning process. The main goals are:

1. Lander stability: Encourage the agent to maintain a stable lander by providing a bonus when the angle and angular velocity are within a certain range.
2. Proper landing: Award the agent with a bonus if it successfully lands the lander, and penalize it for not doing so.
3. Distance from the target: Encourage the agent to keep the lander as close as possible to the target by applying a distance penalty.

This reward function is designed to promote the agent's learning process while ensuring that the lander remains stable and eventually lands correctly.
