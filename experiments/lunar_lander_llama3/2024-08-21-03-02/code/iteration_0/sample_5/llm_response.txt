A reinforcement learning problem!

The reward function I would design for this task is as follows:
```python
def compute_reward(self, state, m_power, s_power, terminated):
    # Define the reward structure
    reward = 0.0
    if not terminated:
        # Reward for moving closer to the helipad (positive)
        reward += -np.abs(state[1])  # negative because we want to move up

        # Punish for falling or being too far from the helipad (negative)
        if abs(state[0]) >= 1.0:
            reward -= 10.0  # penalty for falling
        elif np.abs(state[1]) > 0.5:  # not close enough to helipad
            reward -= 2.0

        # Reward for using main engines (positive)
        if m_power > 0.0:
            reward += 1.0

        # Punish for using side engines too much (negative)
        if s_power > 0.5:  # too much side engine use
            reward -= 2.0

    else:
        # Game over, punish the agent
        reward = -10.0

    return reward, {"main_engine": m_power, "side_engine": s_power}
```
This reward function encourages the agent to:

1. Move closer to the helipad (positive reward).
2. Avoid falling or being too far from the helipad (negative reward).
3. Use main engines to propel itself upwards (positive reward).
4. Avoid using side engines excessively, as this can be detrimental to progress (negative reward).

The individual rewards for main and side engine use are provided to help the agent learn which actions are most effective.

Feel free to adjust or modify this reward function based on your specific requirements!
