Based on the given code snippet, it appears that you're trying to implement a reward function for reinforcement learning. The provided code seems to be part of an environment where an agent (lander) interacts with its surroundings and receives rewards based on its actions.

Here's a possible implementation of your reward function:

```Python
import math

def compute_reward(self, state, m_power, s_power, terminated):
    if terminated:
        return -100.0, {}  # Penalty for episode termination

    pos_x = (state[0] + 1) / 2
    pos_y = (state[1] + 1) / 2

    reward = 0.0

    # Reward for being close to the target location
    if abs(pos_x - 0.5) < 0.05 and abs(pos_y - 0.5) < 0.05:
        reward += 100.0

    # Penalty for not being in contact with all legs
    if state[6] == 0 or state[7] == 0:
        reward -= 10.0

    # Reward for proper orientation (angle close to 0)
    if math.fabs(state[4]) < 0.1:
        reward += 5.0

    # Bonus for high speeds in the x and y directions
    reward += m_power * 2 + s_power * 1.5

    return reward, {'m_power': m_power, 's_power': s_power}
```

In this implementation:

- The function `compute_reward` takes the current state of the environment (`state`), the magnitudes of the main and side engines' thrusts (`m_power`, `s_power`), and a boolean indicating whether the episode has terminated (`terminated`) as inputs.
- If the episode has terminated, it returns a penalty reward (`-100.0`) along with an empty dictionary for individual rewards.
- The function then calculates a base reward based on the agent's position in the x-y plane. The closer the agent is to the target location (centered at `(0.5, 0.5)`, the higher the reward.
- It also deducts a penalty if any leg of the lander is not in contact with the ground (`state[6]` or `state[7]` equal to 0).
- The function then adds bonuses for proper orientation (angle close to 0), main engine thrust magnitude, and side engine thrust magnitude.
- Finally, it returns the calculated reward along with a dictionary containing individual rewards for `m_power` and `s_power`.

This is just one possible implementation of your reward function. You can adjust or modify this code based on your specific requirements and problem domain.
