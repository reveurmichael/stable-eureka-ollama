The reward code is:

```
def compute_reward(self, state, m_power, s_power, terminated):
    pass
```

Note that this is a placeholder for the actual reward function. The goal is to define a reward function that encourages the agent to learn effective control policies. The reward function should reflect the desired behavior of the agent in the environment.
