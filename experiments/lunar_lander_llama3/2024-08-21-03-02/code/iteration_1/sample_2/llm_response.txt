A reinforcement learning problem!

The reward function is implemented in the `compute_reward` method. Based on the provided code, I can see that the reward is calculated as follows:
```python
def compute_reward(self, state, m_power, s_power, terminated):
    # TO DO: implement your own reward function here!
    pass  # or return a default value, e.g., 0.0
```
In other words, the `compute_reward` method is currently just a placeholder and does not provide any actual reward calculation.

To define an effective reward function, you should consider the goals of your agent (e.g., landing safely, collecting resources, completing tasks) and design a reward scheme that encourages or penalizes certain behaviors. For example:
```python
def compute_reward(self, state, m_power, s_power, terminated):
    if not terminated:  # penalty for not reaching the goal
        return -1.0

    if abs(state[0]) >= 1.0:  # penalty for not landing safely
        return -10.0

    if state[-2]:  # reward for collecting resources (assuming `state[-2]` indicates resource collection)
        return 5.0

    # TO DO: add more conditions or modify these as needed!
```
Remember to balance your reward function to avoid over- or under-rewarding certain actions, and make sure it is consistent with the objectives of your agent.

Note that this is just a starting point, and you may need to refine or adjust your reward function based on experimentation and analysis of your agent's performance.
