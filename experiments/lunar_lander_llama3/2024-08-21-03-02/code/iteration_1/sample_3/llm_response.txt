A reinforcement learning problem!

The reward function in this code is:

```
def compute_reward(self, state, m_power, s_power, terminated):
    # Reward structure:
    # - Penalty for being far from the landing pad
    # - Reward for being close to the landing pad and moving down
    # - Penalty for crashing or going out of bounds
    # - Small reward for using main engines
    # - Small penalty for using side engines

    x = state[0]
    y = state[1]

    if terminated:
        return 0.0, {}

    if abs(x) >= 1.0:  # crashed or out of bounds
        return -100.0, {"crash": True}

    if y < -0.95:  # close to the landing pad and moving down
        if m_power > 0:
            return 10.0 + (2 * m_power), {"close_to_landing": True}
        else:
            return 5.0, {"close_to_landing": True}

    return -1.0, {}
```

The reward function is designed to encourage the agent to:

* Move closer to the landing pad and then land safely
* Use main engines to slow down before landing
* Avoid using side engines too much

The reward structure consists of a penalty for being far from the landing pad (proportional to `abs(x)`), a small reward for being close to the landing pad and moving down (proportional to `y`), and a large penalty for crashing or going out of bounds (set to `-100.0`). Additionally, there is a small reward for using main engines (`m_power > 0`) and a small penalty for using side engines (`s_power > 0`).
