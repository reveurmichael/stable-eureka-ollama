The reward code seems to be implemented as follows:

```
def compute_reward(self, state, m_power, s_power, terminated):
    if self.lander.position.y < (self.helipad_y + LEG_DOWN / SCALE):
        # Landed successfully
        return -100.0, {'landed': True}
    elif not terminated:
        # Keep flying and try to land
        return -1.0, {'flying': True}
    else:
        # Game over (crashed or flew too far)
        if state[2] < 0:  # negative x-velocity indicates crash
            return -200.0, {'crashed': True}
        elif abs(state[0]) > 1.0:  # went off screen to the left or right
            return -200.0, {'crashed': True}
        else:
            # Just ran out of time (not crashed)
            return -50.0, {'timeout': True}
```

This reward function seems to be designed to encourage the agent to land safely on the helipad, while avoiding crashes or flying too far off the screen. The rewards are negative and decrease in value as the episode progresses.
