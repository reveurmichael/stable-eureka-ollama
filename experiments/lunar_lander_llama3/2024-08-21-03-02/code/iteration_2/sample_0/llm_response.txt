A reinforcement learning problem!

The provided code seems to be part of a custom-made environment for the Lunar Lander challenge. The `compute_reward` method is responsible for calculating the reward function.

Based on the given code, it appears that the reward function is designed to encourage the agent to successfully land the lunar module while minimizing the fuel consumption and punishing any crash or failure to reach the desired state (i.e., within a certain distance from the helipad).

Here's my attempt at reflecting the reward function:

**Reward Function:**

The reward function is a combination of several components that incentivize the agent to successfully land the lunar module while minimizing fuel consumption.

1. **Landing Success**: +1.0 if the agent lands safely within a certain distance from the helipad, and -1.0 otherwise.
2. **Fuel Consumption**: -0.01 (or some other small negative value) for every unit of fuel consumed, to encourage efficient use of resources.
3. **Crash Penalty**: -1.0 if the agent crashes or fails to reach a certain distance from the helipad.

The reward function can be written as:

`reward = +1.0 * (landed && within_distance) - 0.01 * fuel_consumption - 1.0 * (crashed || !within_distance)`

Where `landed` and `crashed` are boolean indicators, and `fuel_consumption` is a measure of the amount of fuel used.

**Reward Reflection:**

The reward function seems to be designed to balance the need for successful landing with the importance of minimizing fuel consumption. The penalty for crashing or failing to land emphasizes the importance of safety and efficiency in this challenging task.
