The reward code!

Based on the provided code, I assume that you want to create a reward function for reinforcement learning tasks. The reward function should provide a numerical value indicating how well the agent performed in the current episode.

From the given code, it seems that there are two types of rewards: `individual_reward` and `fitness_score`. 

Here's my reflection on your reward code:

1. **Individual Reward**: You have defined an `individual_reward` dictionary to store the individual reward values for each action taken by the agent. This dictionary will be updated with new key-value pairs.

2. **Fitness Score**: The `fitness_score` is another measure of how well the agent performed in the current episode. It's also stored in the `individual_reward` dictionary as a separate entry.

3. **Reward Calculation**: The actual reward calculation seems to involve several factors such as the position, velocity, angle, and angular velocity of the lander. This information is likely used to determine how well the agent performed its tasks, like landing safely or navigating through space.

4. **Termination Criteria**: In addition to the rewards, you have also defined termination criteria based on whether the game is over or not, as well as whether the lander is awake or asleep. This ensures that the episode ends when certain conditions are met.

To create an effective reward function, you should carefully balance the weights of different components in your reward calculation. The goal is to encourage the agent to learn behaviors that lead to desirable outcomes while avoiding undesired ones.

Please note that I'm making these inferences based on the provided code. If my assumptions are incorrect or if there's more context you'd like to share, please feel free to clarify!
