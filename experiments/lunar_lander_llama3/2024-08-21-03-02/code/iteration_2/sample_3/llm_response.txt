Based on the provided code, I can infer that the reward function is a combination of the following components:

1. Proximity to the target location: The closer the lander is to the helipad, the better the reward.
2. Vertical velocity: A higher vertical velocity suggests the lander is moving downwards towards the helipad, which is desirable.
3. Horizontal distance from the center: The farther the lander is from the center of the screen, the worse the reward.
4. Penalty for not being awake: If the lander is not awake (i.e., not moving or falling), there should be a penalty in the reward.

Here's a possible implementation of the reward function:

```
def compute_reward(self, state, m_power, s_power, terminated):
    if terminated:
        # If the game is over, penalize the agent
        return -10.0, {'alive': 1}

    distance_to_target = state[1]  # y-position of lander relative to target
    vertical_velocity = state[3]  # vertical velocity of lander

    reward = distance_to_target * 0.5 + vertical_velocity * 1.0 - abs(state[0]) * 0.2  # proximity to target, vertical velocity, and horizontal distance from center
    if not self.lander.awake:  # if the lander is not awake (i.e., not moving or falling), penalize the agent
        reward -= 5.0

    return reward, {'alive': 1}
```

This implementation combines these components to provide a reward signal that encourages the agent to move towards the target location while maintaining a reasonable vertical velocity and horizontal position.
