A reinforcement learning problem!

The reward code appears to be implemented in the `compute_reward` method. Here's a possible reflection of the reward function:
```
reward = -m_power ** 2 - s_power ** 2  # penalty for using engines
- 0.1 * abs(state[0])  # penalize for being too far from the center
+ 10.0 if not terminated else -1000.0  # reward for reaching the goal, or penalty for failing
```
This is a simplified reflection of the reward function based on the given code. The actual reward function might be more complex and dependent on various factors.

The main components of this reward function are:

1. Penalty for using engines: `-m_power ** 2 - s_power ** 2` This discourages the agent from using the engines excessively.
2. Penalties for being too far from the center: `-0.1 * abs(state[0])` This encourages the agent to stay close to the center of the screen.
3. Reward for reaching the goal (not terminated): `+10.0` This provides a positive reward when the agent successfully reaches the helipad.
4. Penalty for failing (terminated): `-1000.0` This assigns a large negative reward when the episode terminates due to failure.

Note that this is just an educated guess, and the actual reward function might be more complex or different from this reflection.
