The reward code!

The `compute_reward` method is responsible for calculating the reward value based on the current state of the environment. In this case, it takes in the following inputs:

* `state`: The current state of the lander (position, velocity, angle, and angular velocity)
* `m_power`: The main engine power
* `s_power`: The side engine power
* `terminated`: A boolean indicating whether the episode has terminated or not

The reward calculation is quite complex, but it seems to be based on several factors:

1. Keeping the lander close to the helipad: There's a penalty for deviating too far from the helipad (i.e., when `abs(state[0]) >= 1.0`).
2. Maintaining the lander's velocity and angle: The reward seems to be affected by the lander's velocity (`state[3]`) and angle (`state[4]`) relative to the helipad.
3. Using the main and side engines effectively: The reward is influenced by the power levels of the main and side engines (`m_power` and `s_power`, respectively).

The reward value is likely a combination of these factors, with the goal of encouraging the agent to successfully land the spacecraft while minimizing penalties for deviating from the optimal path.

Here's a simplified version of the reward code:
```python
def compute_reward(self, state, m_power, s_power, terminated):
    reward = 0.0

    # Penalty for deviating too far from the helipad
    if abs(state[0]) >= 1.0:
        reward -= 10.0

    # Reward for maintaining a reasonable velocity and angle
    reward += state[3] * 0.5 + state[4] * 0.2

    # Bonus for using main engine effectively (but not too aggressively)
    if m_power > 0.5:
        reward += 2.0 * m_power - 1.0

    # Penalty for using side engines excessively
    if s_power > 0.7:
        reward -= 3.0 * s_power - 2.0

    # Termination penalty (if episode is terminated)
    if terminated:
        reward -= 10.0

    individual_reward = {'main_engine': m_power, 'side_engine': s_power}

    return reward, individual_reward
```
Note that this is a simplified version and may not accurately reflect the original code's behavior.
