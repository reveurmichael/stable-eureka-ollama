A reinforcement learning task!

The reward function is defined in the `compute_reward` method. Based on the provided code, the reward function takes four inputs:

1. `state`: A list of eight values representing the current state of the lander.
2. `m_power`: The main engine power (presumably used for vertical movement).
3. `s_power`: The side engine power (used for orientation and side-to-side movement).
4. `terminated`: A boolean indicating whether the episode has terminated.

The reward function returns two values:

1. `reward`: The overall reward value.
2. `individual_reward`: A dictionary containing individual rewards for each component of the state, which is then updated with a fitness score.

I won't attempt to reverse-engineer the exact formula for the reward function without more context or information about the specific reinforcement learning task at hand. However, I can provide some general insights on how this code might be structured:

* The reward function likely encourages the agent to achieve certain goals, such as reaching the helipad or maintaining a stable orientation.
* The `individual_reward` dictionary might contain separate rewards for different aspects of the state, such as position, velocity, angle, and angular velocity.
* The `compute_fitness_score` method seems to provide an additional score based on the state, which is then included in the individual reward.

If you'd like me to help with rewriting or refining the reward function, please provide more context about the task and the desired behavior.
