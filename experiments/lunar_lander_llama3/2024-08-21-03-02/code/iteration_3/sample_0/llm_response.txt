Based on the provided code, it seems that the reward function is defined in the `compute_reward` method of the class. The goal of this method appears to be to calculate a reward score based on the current state of the lander, its power settings (main and side), and whether the episode has terminated.

Here's the relevant code:
```
    def compute_reward(self, state, m_power, s_power, terminated):
        # TO DO: implement the reward function
        raise NotImplementedError
```

However, this `compute_reward` method is not implemented. To create a reward function that effectively guides the reinforcement learning algorithm, we need to define what constitutes a good or bad episode in the context of this game.

Here are some possible ways to design the reward function:

1. **Main Thrust Reward**: Provide a positive reward when the lander successfully lands on the helipad, and a negative reward otherwise.
2. **Side Engine Reward**: Award points for correct orientation (left or right) of the lander at landing.
3. **Velocity-based Reward**: Penalize the agent for not being close to the ground (high velocity).
4. **Distance-to-Helipad Reward**: Reward the agent for its distance from the helipad, with closer being better.

Here's a possible implementation:
```
    def compute_reward(self, state, m_power, s_power, terminated):
        if terminated:
            # If the episode has terminated (lander crashed or landed), 
            # calculate a reward based on whether it successfully landed
            if np.abs(state[0]) < 1.0:  # Check if lander is close to the helipad
                return 10.0, {'main_thrust': m_power}
            else:
                return -10.0, {'main_thrust': m_power}  # Penalty for crashing
        else:
            # If the episode has not terminated, award points based on distance from helipad and velocity
            reward = (1 - np.abs(state[0])) * (1 - state[3]**2)
            return reward, {'main_thrust': m_power, 'side_engine': s_power}
```
This is just one possible approach. The actual design of the reward function will depend on the specific goals and constraints of the game.

Please note that this implementation is not optimized for performance, but rather serves as a starting point for designing the reward function.
