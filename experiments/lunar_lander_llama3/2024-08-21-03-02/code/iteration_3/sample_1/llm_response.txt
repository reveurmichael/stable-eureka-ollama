The reward function!

From the given code, I can see that the `compute_reward` and `compute_fitness_score` methods are not fully implemented. However, based on the context, here's a possible implementation of the reward function:

```
def compute_reward(self, state, m_power, s_power, terminated):
    reward = 0.0

    # Lander's horizontal position
    pos_x = state[0]
    
    # Reward for staying close to the center (i.e., landing safely)
    if abs(pos_x) < 0.5:
        reward += 1.0
    
    # Penalty for falling off the platform (i.e., going too far left or right)
    else:
        reward -= 10.0 * (abs(pos_x) - 1.0)

    # Additional reward for not crashing
    if not terminated:
        reward += 1.0

    return reward, {'main_engine': m_power, 'side_engines': s_power}
```

This implementation rewards the agent for staying close to the center of the platform (i.e., landing safely) and penalizes it for falling off the platform. Additionally, it provides a small bonus if the lander doesn't crash (i.e., terminated is False).

The `individual_reward` dictionary returned by the reward function contains information about the main and side engines' powers (`m_power` and `s_power`, respectively), which can be used to provide feedback to the agent.
