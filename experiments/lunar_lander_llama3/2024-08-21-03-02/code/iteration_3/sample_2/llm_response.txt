A reinforcement learning task!

After analyzing the code, I'll provide a breakdown of the reward function. Please note that the actual reward calculation might be more complex or nuanced than what's presented here.

**Reward Function**

The reward function seems to encourage the agent to maintain a stable and controlled landing process. It's composed of two parts: `reward` (the overall reward) and `individual_reward`.

1. **Overall Reward (`reward`)**:
The overall reward is not explicitly defined, but it's likely a combination of factors such as:
	* Maintaining a stable altitude (`pos.y`) within a certain range (e.g., around the helipad).
	* Avoiding crashes (`abs(state[0]) >= 1.0`) or game over situations (`self.game_over`).
	* Perhaps some bonus for successful landings or minimizing oscillations.
2. **Individual Reward (`individual_reward`)**:
This reward is likely specific to each episode and might include additional metrics such as:
	* Fitness score (`fitness_score`): This could be a measure of the agent's performance, such as its ability to stabilize the landing process or maintain a desired altitude.

**Termination Conditions**
The reward function also takes into account termination conditions:

1. Game over (`self.game_over`).
2. The lander is no longer awake (`not self.lander.awake`).

These conditions would typically result in a low or negative reward, as they indicate the episode has ended abruptly or the agent has failed to achieve its goals.

**Additional Remarks**

* The reward function might be modified based on specific goals or constraints, such as minimizing fuel consumption or maximizing stability.
* The individual reward could include additional metrics or adjustments depending on the specific task requirements.
* The fitness score might be influenced by factors like landing accuracy, speed, or oscillation frequency.
