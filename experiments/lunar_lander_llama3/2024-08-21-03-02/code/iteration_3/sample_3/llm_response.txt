A reward function!

From the given code, I can see that the reward function is implemented in the `compute_reward` method. Here's what I can infer about the reward design:

1. **Termination condition**: The reward is computed only when the episode is not terminated (i.e., `terminated == False`). This suggests that the reward is designed to encourage the agent to continue exploring the environment.
2. **State-based reward**: The reward seems to be based on the current state of the environment, specifically:
	* `state[0]` (x-position) is used as a threshold for termination (`abs(state[0]) >= 1.0`). This implies that the agent should aim to stay within a certain range of the x-axis.
	* `self.lander.awake` is checked; if it's False, the episode is terminated. This suggests that the agent should keep the lander awake for as long as possible.
3. **Action-dependent reward**: The reward computation also takes into account the action taken by the agent:
	* `m_power` (main engine power) and `s_power` (side engine power) are used to compute the reward. This implies that the agent's actions have a direct impact on the reward.
4. **Individual rewards**: The code suggests that there is an additional reward component, `fitness_score`, which is computed separately and updated in the `individual_reward` dictionary.

Here's my best guess at the reward function:

```
def compute_reward(state, m_power, s_power, terminated):
    if terminated:
        return -1.0  # Termination penalty
    else:
        x_pos = state[0]
        angle = state[4]
        velocity_x = state[2]

        # Reward for staying close to the target (x-axis)
        reward_main_engine = np.clip(1.0 - abs(x_pos), 0, 1)

        # Reward for maintaining orientation (angle)
        reward_orientation = np.clip(np.cos(angle) * 10, 0, 10)

        # Reward for velocity in the x-direction
        reward_velocity_x = np.clip(velocity_x, 0, 5)

        # Main engine power-based bonus
        main_engine_bonus = m_power * 2

        # Side engine power-based bonus (if used)
        side_engine_bonus = s_power * 1.5 if abs(s_power) > 0.5 else 0

        return reward_main_engine + reward_orientation + reward_velocity_x + main_engine_bonus + side_engine_bonus
```

Please note that this is just an educated guess, and the actual reward function might be different or more complex.
