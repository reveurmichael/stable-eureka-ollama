Based on the provided code, the reward function appears to be as follows:

```
def compute_reward(self, state, m_power, s_power, terminated):
    pass
```

This means that no specific reward function has been implemented yet. The `compute_reward` method is a placeholder and needs to be defined according to the problem's requirements and objectives.

The reward function should take into account the desired behavior of the agent (e.g., landing safely, completing tasks efficiently) and provide incentives or penalties accordingly.
