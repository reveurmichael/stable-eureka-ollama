Based on the provided code, the reward function appears to be implemented in the `compute_reward` method. Here's a breakdown of how it might work:

1. The `compute_reward` method takes four inputs:
   - `state`: A list of eight values representing the current state of the lander (position, velocity, angle, and contact with legs).
   - `m_power`: The thrust power applied by the main engines.
   - `s_power`: The thrust power applied by the side engines (orientation/side thrusters).
   - `terminated`: A boolean indicating whether the episode has terminated or not.

2. The method likely computes a reward value based on the provided state, actions (`m_power`, and `s_power`), and termination status.
3. The exact formulation of the reward function is not specified in this code snippet; however, it might involve combinations of terms related to:
   - Achieving specific goals (e.g., landing safely).
   - Penalty for violating constraints or undesirable behaviors (e.g., crashing, falling too far from the target).
   - Encouraging exploration and learning by providing a reward signal for taking actions that lead to more desirable states.

The exact implementation of the `compute_reward` method would depend on the specific design goals and requirements of your reinforcement learning problem.
