A reinforcement learning problem!

The reward function is:
```
def compute_reward(self, state, m_power, s_power, terminated):
    # TO DO: implement your reward function here
    pass
```
In this case, the reward function is not implemented yet. The goal is to design a reward function that encourages the agent to learn effective control policies for landing the spacecraft safely.

The reward function should be designed such that it:

1. Rewards successful landings (i.e., when the spacecraft lands on the helipad).
2. Penalizes crashes, explosions, or other failures.
3. Encourages good control behavior, such as maintaining a stable orientation and velocity during descent.

I can help you design a reward function that achieves these goals!
