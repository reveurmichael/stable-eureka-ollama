Based on the provided code, I can see that the reward function is implemented in the `compute_reward` method of the class. The method takes four parameters: `state`, `m_power`, `s_power`, and `terminated`. Here's how it works:

1. If `game_over` or if the agent has fallen off the edge (`abs(state[0]) >= 1.0`), the reward is set to a negative value (presumably indicating that the episode has ended).
2. If the lander is no longer awake, the reward is also set to a negative value.
3. In all other cases, the reward is calculated based on the `state`, `m_power`, and `s_power` parameters.

The exact formula for calculating the reward is not provided in the code snippet, but it's likely that it involves some combination of these inputs, possibly with scaling factors or thresholds to determine the overall "goodness" of the agent's actions.

Given this information, I would describe the reward function as follows:

**Reward Reflection:**

The reward function aims to encourage the agent to achieve a successful landing by applying thrust in a way that keeps the lander stable and on course. The function seems to be designed such that it provides a positive reward for maintaining altitude and orientation within certain limits, while penalizing the agent for falling off the edge or becoming non-awake.
