A reinforcement learning problem!

After carefully reading the code, I can see that the `compute_reward` method is not explicitly defined. However, based on the provided information and the context of a lunar lander simulation, I can make an educated guess about the structure of this reward function.

Here's my reflection:

**Reward structure:**

The reward is likely designed to encourage the agent (lunar lander) to successfully land on the moon while minimizing errors. The reward might be composed of several components:

1. **Distance from target**: A negative reward for being far away from the target landing position.
2. **Velocity**: A penalty for having high velocities, as this could indicate a rough landing or even crashing.
3. **Angle**: A penalty for not being aligned with the horizontal plane (i.e., the lander is tilted).
4. **Leg contact**: A reward for maintaining leg contact with the lunar surface, indicating a successful landing.

**Individual rewards:**

The `individual_reward` dictionary might contain additional information, such as:

1. **Fitness score**: A score reflecting the agent's overall performance (e.g., distance from target, velocity, and angle).
2. **Momentum power**: The amount of momentum generated by the main engines.
3. **Side thrust**: The effectiveness of side thrusters in stabilizing the lander.

**Reward calculation:**

The `compute_reward` method might calculate the reward based on these components:

1. Initialize a base reward value (e.g., 0).
2. Add or subtract rewards for each component, weighted by their relative importance.
3. Clip the reward to ensure it falls within a reasonable range (e.g., [-10, 10]).

Keep in mind that this is just an educated guess based on the provided code and context. The actual implementation of the `compute_reward` method might differ.
