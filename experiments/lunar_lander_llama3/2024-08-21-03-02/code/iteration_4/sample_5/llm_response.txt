A reinforcement learning problem!

The reward function seems to be defined in the `compute_reward` method. Based on the provided code, I'll make an educated guess about the reward structure.

**Main Engines (Forward Thrust)**:
If the agent applies a forward thrust (`m_power`), it will receive a positive reward proportional to the magnitude of the thrust (`m_power`). This encourages the agent to move forward and gain height.

**Side Engines (Orientation/Thrust)**:
If the agent applies side thrusters (`s_power`) to orient itself or change direction, it will receive a reward proportional to the magnitude of the side thrust (`s_power`). This rewards the agent for adjusting its orientation and movement.

**Termination Conditions**:
The reward function might also take into account termination conditions:

* If the game is over (`self.game_over`), the agent receives a negative or zero reward, indicating that it has failed.
* If the agent's position exceeds certain limits (1.0 in this case), the agent receives a negative or zero reward, indicating that it has fallen out of bounds.

**Additional Reward Modifiers**:
The `compute_reward` method might also consider other factors, such as:

* The agent's velocity and angular velocity to encourage smooth movement and orientation.
* The distance from the helipad to encourage landing safely.
* The agent's legs' ground contact status to discourage excessive jumping or falling.

Please note that this is an educated guess, and I may be missing some details. If you have any additional information about your reward function, please feel free to share!
