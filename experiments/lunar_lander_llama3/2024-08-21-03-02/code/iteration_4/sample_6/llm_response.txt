Based on the given code, the reward function seems to be implemented in the `compute_reward` method. Here's a possible interpretation of the reward reflection:

The reward function appears to encourage the agent to stay away from the edge of the screen ( VIEWPORT_W / SCALE / 2 and VIEWPORT_H / SCALE / 2) while also promoting survival, orientation, and movement.

The individual_reward dictionary seems to hold additional metrics such as the fitness score. The actual reward value is calculated based on the state, m_power, s_power, and termination status.

Here's a possible breakdown of the reward function:

1. Termination penalty: If the game is over or if the agent has reached the edge of the screen (abs(state[0]) >= 1.0), the reward would be -1 or 0, depending on how this is implemented.
2. Orientation and movement bonus: The state[4] represents the lander's angle, which seems to influence the orientation of the side engines. The m_power and s_power variables might reflect the thrust from main and side engines, respectively. A possible reward structure could be:

   - +1 for each unit of m_power (main engine thrust)
   - +0.5 or +1 for each unit of s_power (side engine thrust) if the lander is close to the helipad (pos.y < (self.helipad_y + LEG_DOWN / SCALE))
   - 0 reward when the agent has reached the edge of the screen or game over

3. Survival bonus: The presence of individual legs on the ground (state[6] and state[7]) could provide a survival bonus. A possible reward structure:

   - +1 for each leg grounded
   - 0 if no legs are grounded, or when the agent has reached the edge of the screen or game over

4. Additional metrics: The fitness_score calculated in `compute_fitness_score` might reflect the agent's overall performance, including factors like distance to the helipad, orientation, and movement efficiency.

Keep in mind that this is just one possible interpretation of the reward function based on the provided code. The actual reward logic might differ depending on the specific requirements and constraints of the environment.
