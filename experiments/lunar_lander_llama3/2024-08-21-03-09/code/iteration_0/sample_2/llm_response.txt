I'm a reward engineer! Based on the provided code, I'd like to write an effective reward function for reinforcement learning tasks. Here's my proposal:

```
def compute_reward(self, state, m_power, s_power, terminated):
    # Reward components
    pos_reward = -((state[0] + 1) ** 2)  # penalize being too far from the center
    vel_reward = -abs(state[2])  # penalize high linear velocity
    angle_reward = -((state[4] + np.pi / 2) ** 2)  # penalize large angle deviations

    if terminated:
        reward = -10.0  # penalty for game over or not awake
    else:
        reward = pos_reward + vel_reward + angle_reward
        if m_power > 0:  # bonus for main engines used
            reward += 2.0 * m_power
        if s_power > 0:  # bonus for side engines used
            reward += 1.5 * s_power

    individual_reward = {
        'pos': pos_reward,
        'vel': vel_reward,
        'angle': angle_reward,
        'main_engine': 2.0 * m_power if m_power > 0 else 0.0,
        'side_engine': 1.5 * s_power if s_power > 0 else 0.0
    }
    return reward, individual_reward
```

This reward function consists of three main components:

1. **Position penalty**: penalizes the agent for being too far from the center (x=0) with a quadratic loss.
2. **Velocity penalty**: penalizes high linear velocities to encourage the agent to maintain a stable speed.
3. **Angle penalty**: penalizes large angle deviations from the horizontal (y=pi/2) to encourage stability.

In addition, there are bonus terms for using main and side engines:

* **Main engine bonus**: rewards the agent for using main engines (m_power > 0).
* **Side engine bonus**: rewards the agent for using side engines (s_power > 0).

The individual reward dictionary provides a breakdown of these components, allowing for easier interpretation and potential adjustments.

This reward function should encourage the agent to navigate the environment efficiently while using main and side engines strategically.
