A challenging task! As a reward engineer, I will create an effective reward function for this reinforcement learning task. Here's my attempt:

```python
def compute_reward(self, state, m_power, s_power, terminated):
    # Define the reward components
    position_reward = -abs(state[0])  # penalize deviations from the center
    velocity_reward = -state[2]**2 - state[3]**2  # penalize high velocities
    angle_reward = -state[4]**2  # penalize large angular deviations
    legs_contact_reward = 10.0 * (int(state[6]) + int(state[7]))  # reward for contact with both legs

    # Combine the rewards
    individual_reward = m_power * position_reward + s_power * velocity_reward - angle_reward + legs_contact_reward

    if terminated:
        individual_reward -= 100.0  # penalize termination

    return individual_reward, {'position': position_reward, 'velocity': velocity_reward, 'angle': angle_reward, 'legs_contact': legs_contact_reward}
```

In this reward function:

1. I've defined four components: `position_reward`, `velocity_reward`, `angle_reward`, and `legs_contact_reward`.
2. The `position_reward` penalizes the agent for deviating from the center of the viewport.
3. The `velocity_reward` penalizes high velocities, which can be detrimental to the agent's performance.
4. The `angle_reward` penalizes large angular deviations, which can indicate poor orientation.
5. The `legs_contact_reward` rewards the agent for contacting both legs with the ground, indicating stability and control.

6. I've combined these components using weights based on the magnitude of the main (`m_power`) and side (`s_power`) engines' powers.

7. If the episode is terminated, I've added a penalty to discourage termination.

8. The individual reward is returned along with a dictionary containing the component rewards for further analysis.

This reward function aims to encourage the agent to maintain a stable position, moderate velocities, and orient itself correctly while contacting both legs with the ground.
