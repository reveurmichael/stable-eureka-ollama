A reinforcement learning problem!

I see that you have a `compute_reward` method in your code. Let's break it down:

```python
def compute_reward(self, state, m_power, s_power, terminated):
    # Your reward function goes here!
    # For example:
    if not terminated:
        return 0.1 * (state[2] ** 2 + state[3] ** 2) - 0.01 * (abs(state[4]) ** 2), {}
    else:
        return -10, {'game_over': True}
```

In this example, the reward is based on the lander's velocity and orientation. When the episode is not terminated, the reward is a function of the squared velocities and the absolute value of the orientation (to encourage the lander to stay upright). The coefficient values (0.1, 0.01) can be tuned to balance exploration and exploitation.

When the episode is terminated (e.g., due to game over or the lander being asleep), the reward is -10 with a note that the game is over (`{'game_over': True}`). This could be used as a penalty for not completing the episode successfully.

Note that you can customize this reward function based on your specific problem requirements and exploration-exploitation trade-offs.
