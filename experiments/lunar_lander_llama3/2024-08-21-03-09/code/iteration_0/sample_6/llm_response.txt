I'll assume that the task is to create a position-based reward function for this reinforcement learning environment. 

Here's how you could write your reward function:

```
def compute_reward(self, state, m_power, s_power, terminated):
    # Define the reward structure
    if not terminated:
        # Reward for moving forward (more negative value means more desirable)
        x_reward = -5 * abs(state[0])
        
        # Punish for moving too far from the center
        distance_from_center = min(abs(state[0]), 1.0)  # Ensure it's between 0 and 1
        punish = -10 * (distance_from_center ** 2)
        
        # Reward for not falling down
        y_reward = -5 * abs(state[1])
        
        reward = x_reward + punish + y_reward
        
    else:
        if state[0] >= 1.0:  # If the agent has landed on the helipad
            reward = 10
        elif self.lander.position.y < (self.helipad_y - LEG_DOWN / SCALE):  # If the agent is still in the air and away from the helipad
            reward = -10
        else:
            reward = -5
        
    individual_reward = {
        "main_engine_power": m_power,
        "side_engine_power": s_power,
        "reward": reward
    }
    
    return reward, individual_reward
```

This reward function is designed to encourage the agent to move forward and avoid falling down. It also provides a bonus when the agent lands on the helipad. The `individual_reward` dictionary allows you to keep track of the individual engine powers used during this episode.
