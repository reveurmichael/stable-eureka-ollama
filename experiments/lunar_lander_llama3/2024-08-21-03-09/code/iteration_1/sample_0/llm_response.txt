A reinforcement learning problem!

The reward function is given by the `compute_reward` method. Based on the provided code, the reward function appears to be a combination of several components:

1. **Landing**: If the lander has landed (`self.game_over` is True), the reward might be high or zero.
2. **Distance from target**: The distance from the lander's current position to the target location (`VIEWPORT_W / SCALE / 2`, `VIEWPORT_H / SCALE / 2`) seems to influence the reward. If the lander is close to the target, the reward could be higher.
3. **Velocity**: The magnitude of the lander's velocity might also impact the reward. Faster velocities could result in a lower reward.

The individual_reward dictionary contains a 'fitness_score' key, which suggests that this score is related to the agent's performance (e.g., the distance from the target or the angle with respect to the target).

Without more information about the desired behavior of the lander and the specific requirements of the task, it's challenging to provide a more detailed analysis.
