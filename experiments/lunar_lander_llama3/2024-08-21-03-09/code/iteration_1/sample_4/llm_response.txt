Based on the provided code, it appears that the reward function is implemented in the `compute_reward` method. The method takes in several parameters:

* `state`: a list of 8 values representing the current state of the environment
* `m_power`: the main engine power
* `s_power`: the side engines' power
* `terminated`: a boolean indicating whether the episode has terminated

The reward function is not explicitly defined, but it can be inferred from the code. The reward seems to depend on the state and the actions taken (i.e., the main and side engine powers). The termination condition also affects the reward.

Here's a possible reward reflection based on the provided code:

```
def compute_reward(state, m_power, s_power, terminated):
    # Define a reward function that encourages the agent to
    # maintain its position near the center of the viewport,
    # while also promoting the use of main and side engines.
    # The reward is highest when the lander is centered and using both engines.
    # It decreases as the lander moves away from the center or uses only one engine.

    reward = 0.0
    if not terminated:
        # Calculate a position-based reward
        pos_x = state[0]
        if abs(pos_x) < 0.5:  # near the center
            reward += 1.0
        else:
            reward -= 0.1 * (abs(pos_x) - 0.5)  # penalize for being too far

        # Calculate an engine-based reward
        if m_power > 0 and s_power > 0:  # both engines are on
            reward += 0.2
        elif m_power > 0 or s_power > 0:  # at least one engine is on
            reward += 0.1

    return reward, {"main_engine": m_power, "side_engines": s_power}
```

This reward function provides a basic structure for encouraging the agent to maintain its position near the center of the viewport and use both main and side engines effectively. The specific weights and calculations can be adjusted based on the desired behavior and performance metrics.
