The reward function!

In this code, I notice that the `compute_reward` method is responsible for calculating the reward. The reward seems to be a combination of individual rewards and fitness scores.

Here's my interpretation of the reward function:
```
reward, individual_reward = self.compute_reward(state, m_power, s_power, terminated)
```
The `compute_reward` method takes in four inputs:

1. `state`: The current state of the environment (a list of 8 values).
2. `m_power` and `s_power`: The magnitudes of the main engine power and side engines power, respectively.
3. `terminated`: A boolean indicating whether the episode is terminated or not.

The method returns two values:

1. `reward`: The total reward for the current episode.
2. `individual_reward`: A dictionary containing individual rewards (I'll assume this is used to compute the fitness score).

In the absence of more context, I'd venture a guess that the reward function is designed to encourage the agent to:

* Keep the lander close to the target location (low values for `state[0]` and `state[1]`)
* Maintain stable velocity and orientation (low values for `vel.x`, `vel.y`, and `self.lander.angle`)
* Avoid crashing or falling off the edge of the screen (high value for `abs(state[0]) < 1.0`)

Please correct me if I'm wrong, and feel free to provide more details about the reward function!
