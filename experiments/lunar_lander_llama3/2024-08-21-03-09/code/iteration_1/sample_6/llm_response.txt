The reward code!

After analyzing the provided code, I can see that the reward function is not explicitly defined. However, based on the provided compute_reward and compute_fitness_score functions, I can infer how the reward might be calculated.

Here's a possible representation of the reward reflection:

```
def compute_reward(state, m_power, s_power, terminated):
    # Calculate reward based on state
    if terminated:
        return -10.0, {'failure': True}  # Game over or lander not awake; failure
    else:
        # Calculate distance to target (helipad_y)
        distance_to_target = abs(state[1])
        reward = 1.0 / distance_to_target  # Higher reward for being closer to target

        if state[4] > 5:  # Land angle above a certain threshold
            # Penalize excessive lander tilt
            penalty = -0.1 * (state[4] - 5)
        else:
            penalty = 0

        return reward + penalty, {'progress': reward, 'penalty': penalty}

def compute_fitness_score(state, m_power, s_power, terminated):
    # Calculate fitness score based on state
    if terminated:
        return 1.0  # Game over or lander not awake; low fitness
    else:
        # Calculate fitness score based on distance to target and lander tilt
        fitness = 10.0 / (abs(state[1]) + state[4])
        return fitness

```

In this representation, the reward is calculated based on the state of the environment:

* If the game is over or the lander is not awake, a failure penalty is applied.
* Otherwise, the distance to the target helipad_y is used to calculate a progress reward. The closer the lander is to the target, the higher the reward.
* Excessive tilt of the lander (above 5 degrees) incurs a penalty.

The fitness score is also calculated based on the state:

* If the game is over or the lander is not awake, a low fitness score is assigned.
* Otherwise, the fitness score is calculated as the reciprocal of the sum of the distance to the target and the lander tilt.
