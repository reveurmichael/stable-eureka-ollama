A reinforcement learning problem!

The reward function appears to be defined in the `compute_reward` method. Here's a possible breakdown of what I see:

1. The reward is a scalar value that depends on the current state `state`, the actions `m_power` and `s_power` taken by the agent, and whether the episode has terminated or not.
2. The reward is composed of two parts: an individual reward and a global reward. The individual reward seems to be used for updating the policy, while the global reward might be used for evaluating the overall performance of the agent.

The individual reward `individual_reward` is updated with additional information (e.g., fitness score) in the line:

```
individual_reward.update({'fitness_score': fitness_score})
```

This suggests that the individual reward might be used to guide the policy towards a specific goal or optimization criterion, while the global reward could be used to evaluate the overall performance of the agent.

The `compute_fitness_score` method is called to compute the fitness score based on the current state and actions taken. This score might be used to evaluate the performance of the agent in terms of its ability to reach certain goals or maintain a stable state.

In summary, the reward function appears to be designed to balance individual rewards for specific actions with global rewards that reflect the overall performance of the agent.
