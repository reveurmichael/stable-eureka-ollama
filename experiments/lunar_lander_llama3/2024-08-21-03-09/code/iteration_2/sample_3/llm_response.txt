Based on the provided code, it appears that the reward function is implemented in the `compute_reward` method. The goal of this method is to calculate a reward based on the current state of the lander and the actions taken (i.e., the main engine thrust (`m_power`) and side engines thrust (`s_power`)).

Here's what I've observed:

1. The `compute_reward` method takes five arguments: `state`, `m_power`, `s_power`, and `terminated`. 
2. It seems that the reward is calculated based on the state of the lander, its velocity, position, and whether it has achieved a successful landing (i.e., `self.game_over`). If the game is over or the lander is too far away from the target (`abs(state[0]) >= 1.0`), the reward is likely to be negative.
3. The `individual_reward` dictionary is updated with the calculated reward and the fitness score.

The actual reward calculation logic might vary depending on the specific requirements of your reinforcement learning task. If you'd like me to help you design a more effective reward function, please provide more details about your problem formulation!
