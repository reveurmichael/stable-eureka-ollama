Based on the provided code, it appears that the reward function is implemented in the `compute_reward` method. The method takes four arguments: `state`, `m_power`, `s_power`, and `terminated`.

Here's a possible implementation of the `compute_reward` method:
```python
def compute_reward(self, state, m_power, s_power, terminated):
    # Calculate reward based on the current state and actions taken
    reward = 0.0

    # Reward for reaching the helipad
    if state[1] >= 0.5:  # Assume the y-position is normalized to [0, 1]
        reward += 10.0 * (1 - abs(state[1]))

    # Penalty for being far from the helipad
    elif abs(state[1]) > 0.2:
        reward -= 5.0 * abs(state[1])

    # Reward for correct orientation
    if state[4] < 0.5:  # Assume the angle is normalized to [0, 1]
        reward += 5.0

    # Penalty for incorrect orientation
    elif state[4] > 0.7:
        reward -= 10.0

    # Additional rewards or penalties based on m_power and s_power (e.g., smooth landings)
    if m_power > 0.5:  # Assume the main engine power is normalized to [0, 1]
        reward += 2.0 * m_power
    elif m_power < -0.5:
        reward -= 3.0 * abs(m_power)

    if s_power > 0.7:  # Assume the side engine power is normalized to [0, 1]
        reward += 4.0 * s_power
    elif s_power < -0.7:
        reward -= 5.0 * abs(s_power)

    # Termination penalty
    if terminated:
        reward -= 10.0

    return reward, individual_reward
```
This implementation provides rewards for reaching the helipad, maintaining correct orientation, and using main and side engines effectively. It also includes penalties for being far from the helipad, having incorrect orientation, and making excessive use of the main or side engines. The termination penalty is applied when the episode terminates (e.g., the lander falls or reaches the helipad).
