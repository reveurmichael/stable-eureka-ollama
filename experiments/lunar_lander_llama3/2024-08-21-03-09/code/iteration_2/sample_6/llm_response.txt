A reinforcement learning problem!

The reward function is not explicitly defined in the given code. However, based on the `compute_reward` method signature and its usage in the main loop, it appears that the reward is computed as a function of the state, `m_power`, `s_power`, and `terminated`.

The `compute_reward` method takes six arguments:

1. `state`: The current state of the environment (a list of eight values).
2. `m_power`: The power applied to the main engines.
3. `s_power`: The power applied to the side engines.
4. `terminated`: A boolean indicating whether the episode is terminated.

The method returns two values:

1. `reward`: The reward value for the current state and actions.
2. `individual_reward`: A dictionary containing additional information about the reward (possibly used for logging or visualization).

Without knowing more about the specific problem and its objectives, it's difficult to provide a precise reflection of the reward function. However, based on the context, it's likely that the reward is designed to encourage the agent to:

* Move towards the helipad while keeping the lander stable and airborne.
* Use the main engines efficiently (e.g., by applying power when needed).
* Avoid using the side engines excessively or inappropriately.

The `fitness_score` returned by `compute_fitness_score` might be used as a secondary metric to evaluate the agent's performance, but it's not directly related to the reward function.
