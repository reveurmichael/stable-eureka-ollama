Based on the provided environment code, I can infer that the reward function should reflect the following aspects:

1. **Survival**: The agent should receive a positive reward for staying alive and not crashing.
2. **Progress towards the helipad**: The agent receives a positive reward for moving closer to the helipad.
3. **Angular momentum**: The agent receives a negative reward for spinning out of control (i.e., high angular velocity).
4. **Leg contact**: The agent receives a positive reward for maintaining leg contact with the ground.

Considering these aspects, I propose the following reward function:

```
def compute_reward(self, state, m_power, s_power, terminated):
    if terminated:
        return -10.0  # penalty for termination

    # Survival bonus
    survival_bonus = 1.0 if self.lander.awake else -5.0

    # Progress towards the helipad (reward closer proximity)
    distance_to_helipad = abs(state[1])  # y-position of lander relative to helipad
    progress_reward = 10.0 - distance_to_helipad

    # Angular momentum penalty
    angular_momentum_penalty = -0.1 * np.abs(state[5])  # absolute value of angular velocity

    # Leg contact bonus (up to a maximum)
    leg_contact_bonus = min(2.0, state[6] + state[7])  # sum of leg contacts

    reward = survival_bonus + progress_reward + angular_momentum_penalty + leg_contact_bonus
    individual_reward = {'survival_bonus': survival_bonus,
                          'progress_reward': progress_reward,
                          'angular_momentum_penalty': angular_momentum_penalty,
                          'leg_contact_bonus': leg_contact_bonus}

    return reward, individual_reward
```

This reward function provides a balance between survival, progress towards the helipad, and maintaining control (by penalizing high angular momentum). Leg contact is also rewarded to encourage the agent to maintain stability. The `individual_reward` dictionary provides a breakdown of the rewards for each component.
