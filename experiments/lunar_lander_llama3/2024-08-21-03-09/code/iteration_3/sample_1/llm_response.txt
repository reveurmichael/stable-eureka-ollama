The reward code!

Here's the reward function:
```
def compute_reward(self, state, m_power, s_power, terminated):
    # To be implemented...
    pass
```
This is a placeholder for the reward function. The goal is to design a reward function that encourages the agent to learn effective policies for landing the spacecraft.

Some possible approaches:

1. **Landing success**: Reward the agent for successfully landing the spacecraft (e.g., within a certain distance from the target).
2. **Penalize crashes**: Penalize the agent if it crashes or fails to land properly.
3. **Reward proximity**: Reward the agent for getting closer to the target, with a higher reward for landing closer.
4. **Reward speed and control**: Reward the agent for maintaining a stable velocity and orientation during the landing process.

The `compute_reward` function will take in the current state of the environment (e.g., position, velocity, angle), as well as the magnitudes of the main engine (`m_power`) and side engines (`s_power`). The function should return a scalar reward value that reflects the agent's progress towards its goals.
