The reward function!

From the provided code, I can infer that the reward function is implemented in the `compute_reward` method. The reward function takes four inputs:

1. `state`: a list of eight values representing the current state of the environment (lander's position, velocity, angle, and angular velocity, as well as contact with the ground).
2. `m_power`: the main engine power.
3. `s_power`: the side engine power.
4. `terminated`: a boolean indicating whether the episode has terminated.

The reward function returns two values:

1. `reward`: the overall reward for the current state and actions taken.
2. `individual_reward`: a dictionary containing additional rewards or metrics, such as the fitness score.

Here's a rough outline of how the reward function might be implemented:
```python
def compute_reward(self, state, m_power, s_power, terminated):
    # Define base rewards for main engine, side engines, and other factors (e.g., orientation)
    reward = 0.0

    if not terminated:
        # Main engine reward based on distance traveled or speed
        reward += m_power * np.clip(state[0], -1.0, 1.0)  # position-based reward

        # Side engine reward based on orientation and movement
        reward += s_power * np.cos(state[4])  # orientation-based reward

        # Add other rewards or penalties as needed (e.g., for crashes or low altitude)

    if terminated:
        # Penalty for terminating the episode early
        reward -= 10.0

    individual_reward = {'fitness_score': self.compute_fitness_score(state, m_power, s_power, terminated)}
    return reward, individual_reward
```
Note that this is just a rough outline, and the actual implementation might be more complex or nuanced depending on the specific requirements of your reinforcement learning task.
