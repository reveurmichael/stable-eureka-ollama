Based on the provided code, it appears that the reward function is not explicitly defined. The `compute_reward` and `compute_fitness_score` functions are called in the main loop, but their implementations are not shown.

However, based on the context and the available information, I can provide a possible reward reflection:

The `compute_reward` function likely takes the current state of the environment (represented by the `state` variable), as well as the actions taken by the agent (`m_power` and `s_power`) as inputs. The goal is to provide a numerical value that reflects how well the agent has performed.

The reward might be designed to incentivize the agent to:

* Move towards the center of the screen (as indicated by the first two elements of the state vector)
* Maintain a certain velocity or speed
* Keep the lander upright and stable (indicated by the `angle` and `angularVelocity` values in the state vector)
* Avoid crashing or falling off the platform (indicated by the `ground_contact` values)

The reward might also take into account penalties for undesired actions, such as using too much power or applying forces that are too strong.

The exact implementation of the reward function would depend on the specific goals and constraints of the environment.
