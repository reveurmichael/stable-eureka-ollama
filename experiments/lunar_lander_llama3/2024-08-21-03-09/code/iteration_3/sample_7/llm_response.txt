A reinforcement learning problem!

The reward function is not explicitly provided in the given code. However, I can infer that there are two types of rewards: `reward` and `individual_reward`.

From the code, it seems that `reward` is computed by calling the `compute_reward` method, which takes the current state, `m_power`, `s_power`, and a boolean indicating whether the episode has terminated.

The `compute_fitness_score` method is also called to compute an additional fitness score for the individual. This fitness score is then added to the `individual_reward` dictionary.

Without more information about the problem or the desired behavior of the reward function, it's difficult to provide a specific reward function implementation. However, I can suggest some possible approaches:

1. **Simple distance-based reward**: Reward the agent for being closer to the target location (e.g., the helipad). The reward could decrease as the agent moves further away from the target.
2. **Angle and velocity-based reward**: Reward the agent for maintaining a desired angle and velocity while approaching the target location.
3. **Episode termination-based reward**: Reward or penalize the agent based on whether it has successfully landed (reward) or crashed (penalty).

Please provide more context or clarify the objectives of the problem, and I can help design a suitable reward function!
