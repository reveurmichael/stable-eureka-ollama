Based on the provided code, it appears that the reward function is not explicitly defined. However, I can infer some aspects of the reward function based on the existing code.

The `compute_reward` method seems to be responsible for calculating the reward value. It takes in four arguments:

1. `state`: The current state of the environment.
2. `m_power`: The main engine power (presumably related to the thrust).
3. `s_power`: The side engine power (presumably related to the orientation-dependent torque).
4. `terminated`: A boolean indicating whether the episode has terminated.

The reward function likely takes these inputs and returns a numerical value that reflects the agent's performance. However, without seeing the actual implementation of `compute_reward`, it's difficult to provide more specific details about the reward structure.

Some possible aspects of the reward function could include:

* Rewarding the agent for successfully landing on the helipad (e.g., by assigning a high reward when the agent is close to or has landed on the helipad).
* Penalizing the agent for falling off the cliff or not landing safely (e.g., by assigning a negative reward when the agent's height or velocity is outside an acceptable range).
* Encouraging the agent to use its main and side engines effectively, possibly by rewarding thrust-related actions that lead to progress towards the helipad.

Please provide more context or clarify the `compute_reward` method if you'd like me to elaborate further.
