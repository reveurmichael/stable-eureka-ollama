A reinforcement learning problem!

The reward function for this problem appears to be implemented in the `compute_reward` method. Here's a breakdown of what I see:
```python
def compute_reward(self, state, m_power, s_power, terminated):
    # TO DO: implement your own reward function
    pass
```
Since it's left blank, we can infer that the reward is not yet defined.

Typically, a reward function in reinforcement learning aims to encourage or discourage certain behaviors based on the agent's actions and environment state. In this case, the goal seems to be to land safely and efficiently.

To design an effective reward function, I'd suggest considering the following factors:

1. **Landing safely**: Reward the agent when it lands safely (e.g., no crash, within a certain distance from the helipad).
2. **Efficient landing**: Encourage the agent to land quickly by rewarding shorter times spent in the air.
3. **Fuel efficiency**: Punish the agent for using excessive fuel (represented by `m_power` and `s_power`) or encourage it to use less fuel when possible.

Here's a simple example of how you could implement these factors:
```python
def compute_reward(self, state, m_power, s_power, terminated):
    reward = 0.0

    if not terminated:
        # Reward for safe landing (distance from helipad)
        distance_to_helipad = np.linalg.norm(state[:2])
        reward += -distance_to_helipad / (VIEWPORT_W / SCALE)

        # Punish excessive fuel use
        if m_power > 0.5 or s_power > 1.0:
            reward -= 0.1

    if terminated and not self.game_over:
        # Penalize crash landing
        reward -= 10.0

    return reward, {}
```
This is just a starting point, and you may want to adjust the weights or add more factors to your reward function depending on your specific problem requirements.

Remember to consider the `terminated` flag, which indicates whether the episode has ended (e.g., due to crash landing). In this case, we penalize crash landings when they occur.
