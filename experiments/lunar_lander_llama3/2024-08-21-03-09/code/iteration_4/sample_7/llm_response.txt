A challenge!

The reward code you're looking for is likely the implementation of the `compute_reward` method. Based on the provided code, I'll try to extract the reward function.

The `compute_reward` method takes four inputs:

1. `state`: a list of eight values representing the lander's position, velocity, orientation, and contact status.
2. `m_power`: the main engine power (a scalar value).
3. `s_power`: the side engine power (a scalar value).
4. `terminated`: a boolean indicating whether the episode has terminated.

The method returns two values:

1. `reward`: the cumulative reward for the current step.
2. `individual_reward`: a dictionary containing additional reward-related information, including the `fitness_score`.

Based on the code, I'll attempt to reconstruct the reward function:
```python
def compute_reward(state, m_power, s_power, terminated):
    # Define constants
    REWARD_MAIN_ENGINE = 1.0
    REWARD_SIDE_ENGINE = -0.5
    REWARD_TERMINATION = -10.0

    # Calculate the main engine reward
    main_engine_reward = REWARD_MAIN_ENGINE * m_power

    # Calculate the side engine reward (only applicable if side engines are used)
    if s_power > 0:
        side_engine_reward = REWARD_SIDE_ENGINE * s_power
    else:
        side_engine_reward = 0.0

    # Termination penalty (if the episode has terminated)
    if terminated:
        reward = -REWARD_TERMINATION
    else:
        reward = main_engine_reward + side_engine_reward

    individual_reward = {'main_engine': main_engine_reward, 'side_engine': side_engine_reward}

    return reward, individual_reward
```
Please note that this is an educated guess based on the provided code. The actual reward function might differ depending on specific requirements or implementation details.
