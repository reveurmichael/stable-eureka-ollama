I'm a reward engineer! Based on the provided code, I'll create an effective reward function for reinforcement learning tasks. Here it is:

```
def compute_reward(self, state, m_power, s_power, terminated):
    # Define a sparse reward structure
    R = 0.0

    if not terminated:
        # Reward for moving forward (x-axis)
        if state[0] > 0:
            R += 1.0

        # Punish for going backward (x-axis)
        elif state[0] < -1.0:
            R -= 5.0

        # Reward for keeping the lander's angle within a certain range
        if abs(state[4]) < 30.0:
            R += 2.0

        # Punish for significant angular deviation from the ideal angle
        elif abs(state[4]) > 60.0:
            R -= 10.0

    else:
        # Game over, penalize heavily
        R -= 50.0

    if s_power > 0.5:  # Orientation/Side engines engaged
        R += 2.0 * s_power  # Reward for side engine usage
    elif m_power > 0.5:  # Main engines engaged
        R += 4.0 * m_power  # Reward for main engine usage

    return R, individual_reward
```

In this reward function:

1. We encourage the agent to move forward in the x-axis by rewarding it when `state[0] > 0`. Conversely, we penalize it when `state[0] < -1.0`, indicating a significant backward movement.
2. We incentivize the agent to maintain a stable angle (within 30 degrees) by rewarding it with a moderate value (`R += 2.0`).
3. If the lander's angular deviation exceeds 60 degrees, we penalize it heavily (`R -= 10.0`) to discourage excessive rotation.
4. When the game is over, we impose a significant penalty (`R -= 50.0`) to emphasize the importance of completing the mission.
5. We also reward the agent for engaging side engines (`s_power > 0.5`) and main engines (`m_power > 0.5`) with values proportional to their usage.

This reward function is designed to encourage the agent to navigate the lander effectively, manage its orientation, and use both main and side engines efficiently while completing the mission.
