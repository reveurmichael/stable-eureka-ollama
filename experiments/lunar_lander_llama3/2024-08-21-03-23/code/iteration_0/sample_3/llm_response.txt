A challenge!

The reward function I would suggest for this problem is a combination of rewards for good performance and penalties for bad performance. Here's the code:
```python
def compute_reward(self, state, m_power, s_power, terminated):
    # Good landing and survival (100 points)
    if not terminated and state[0] < 1.0:  # within the viewport
        reward = 100.0
    
    # Penalty for crashing or going out of bounds (0 points)
    elif terminated:
        reward = -100.0
    
    # Reward for proper orientation (10 points per degree)
    elif abs(state[4]) < 5.0:  # within 5 degrees from horizontal
        reward = 10.0 * (1.0 - abs(state[4]) / 5.0)
    
    # Penalty for excessive rotation (5 points per degree)
    elif state[5] > 2.0:  # more than 2 degrees of rotation
        reward = -5.0 * state[5]
    
    # Reward for using main engines (10 points per unit of m_power)
    if m_power > 0:
        reward += 10.0 * m_power
    
    # Penalty for using side engines (5 points per unit of s_power)
    elif s_power > 0:
        reward -= 5.0 * s_power
    
    return reward, individual_reward
```
This reward function encourages the agent to:

1. Land safely and within the viewport (100 points).
2. Avoid crashing or going out of bounds (-100 points).
3. Maintain a proper orientation (10 points per degree, up to 50 degrees from horizontal).
4. Use main engines efficiently (10 points per unit of `m_power`).
5. Minimize side engine usage (5 points per unit of `s_power`).

Note that the reward values are arbitrary and can be adjusted according to the specific requirements of your problem.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
