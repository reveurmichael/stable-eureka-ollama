A reward engineering problem!

Given the dynamics of the lunar lander simulation and the state observations provided, I would suggest the following reward function:

**Reward Function:**

```
def compute_reward(state, m_power, s_power, terminated):
    # Reward structure:
    # - Penalties for being too far from the target (-10 per unit)
    # - Penalties for not being awake and ready to land (-5 if not awake)
    # - Bonus for a successful landing (+100 if landed safely)
    # - Small bonus for using main engines (+2 for every 0.1 seconds of main engine usage)
    # - Bonus for side engine usage (+5 for every 0.1 seconds of side engine usage)

    reward = 0

    if terminated:
        # Game over, calculate a final reward
        if state[0] >= 1.0:  # successfully landed
            reward += 100
        else:
            reward -= 10 * abs(state[0])  # penalty for not landing

        if not self.lander.awake:  # not awake and ready to land
            reward -= 5

    else:
        # Ongoing reward calculation
        reward -= 10 * abs(state[0])  # penalty for being too far from the target
        if m_power > 0:  # using main engines
            reward += 2 * (m_power / 0.1)  # bonus for main engine usage

        if s_power > 0:  # using side engines
            reward += 5 * (s_power / 0.1)  # bonus for side engine usage

    return -reward, individual_reward
```

This reward function aims to balance the exploration-exploitation tradeoff by providing a mix of intrinsic and extrinsic rewards. The primary goal is to encourage the agent to land safely while minimizing penalties for being too far from the target.

**Notes:**

* The `individual_reward` dictionary should be updated with the calculated reward and fitness score.
* In the final state, we only calculate a single reward value that reflects the success or failure of the landing.
