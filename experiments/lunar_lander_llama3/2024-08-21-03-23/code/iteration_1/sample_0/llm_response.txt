What a delightful task!

Based on the provided code, I'd say that your reward function is defined as follows:
```python
def compute_reward(self, state, m_power, s_power, terminated):
    # TO DO: Implement your reward function here!
    pass
```
The `compute_reward` method takes in four inputs:

1. `state`: a list of 8 values representing the lander's position, velocity, angle, and ground contacts.
2. `m_power`: the main engine power (not used in the code snippet provided).
3. `s_power`: the side engine power (not used in the code snippet provided).
4. `terminated`: a boolean indicating whether the episode is terminated.

The method should return two values:

1. `reward`: a numerical value representing the reward for the current state.
2. `individual_reward`: a dictionary containing additional information about the agent's performance, such as the fitness score (which is already computed in the provided code).

To complete the reward function, you'll need to decide on a suitable reward scheme that encourages the agent to achieve its goals (e.g., landing safely, maximizing altitude, etc.).
