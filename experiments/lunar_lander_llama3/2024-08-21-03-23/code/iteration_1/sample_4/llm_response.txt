Based on the provided code, the reward function seems to be implemented in the `compute_reward` method. However, without the implementation of this method, it's difficult to provide a specific reflection.

From what I can see, the reward and individual reward are calculated based on the state, m_power, s_power, and terminated. The exact calculation is not provided in this snippet, but presumably it depends on some criteria such as the lander's position, velocity, angle, and angular velocity, as well as whether the game is over or not.

Here's a possible reflection of the reward function:

* The reward might be positive when the lander is close to the target (helipad) and has a low speed.
* It could be negative when the lander is far from the target or has high speeds.
* In case the game is over, the reward might be 0 or negative to discourage further exploration.
* The individual reward could be used to encourage the agent to explore different actions (m_power and s_power) without affecting the overall reward.

Please note that this is just a possible reflection based on the provided code. The actual implementation of the reward function might be more complex and depend on various factors.
