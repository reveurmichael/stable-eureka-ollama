A reinforcement learning problem!

The reward function is defined in the `compute_reward` method. Based on the given code, the reward function takes five inputs:

1. `state`: A list of eight values representing the lander's position, velocity, angle, and angular velocity, as well as contact information for its legs.
2. `m_power`: The main engine power (not used in the reward calculation).
3. `s_power`: The side engine power (not used in the reward calculation).
4. `terminated`: A boolean indicating whether the episode has terminated.

The `compute_reward` method returns two values:

1. `reward`: The total reward for the episode.
2. `individual_reward`: A dictionary containing individual rewards for each step, with an additional key-value pair for the `fitness_score`.

Based on the code, it appears that the reward function is not explicitly defined and might be a placeholder or incomplete.
