Based on the provided code, I can infer that the reward function is likely defined in the `compute_reward` method. Here's a possible implementation of the reward function:

```
def compute_reward(self, state, m_power, s_power, terminated):
    # Define constants for the reward shaping
    LANDING_REWARD = 1.0
    CRASH_PENALTY = -1.0
    MOVEMENT_PENALTY = -0.05
    ORIENTATION_REWARD = 0.5

    # Calculate the reward based on the state and actions taken
    if terminated:
        if self.game_over:  # Landed successfully
            return LANDING_REWARD, {'landing': LANDING_REWARD}
        else:  # Crashed
            return CRASH_PENALTY, {'crash': CRASH_PENALTY}

    # Reward for movement (away from the landing site)
    if state[0] > 1.0:
        return MOVEMENT_PENALTY, {'movement': MOVEMENT_PENALTY}
    elif state[0] < -1.0:
        return MOVEMENT_PENALTY, {'movement': MOVEMENT_PENALTY}

    # Reward for orientation (close to the vertical)
    if np.abs(state[4]) > 0.5:
        return ORIENTATION_REWARD, {'orientation': ORIENTATION_REWARD}

    # No specific reward or penalty for now
    return 0.0, {}
```

This reward function provides a basic shaping of the reward based on the state and actions taken by the agent. The goal is to encourage the agent to move away from the landing site (penalizing movement towards it), orient itself close to vertical (rewards orientation), and eventually land successfully (gives a high reward).
