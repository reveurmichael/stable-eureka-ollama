A reinforcement learning problem!

The reward function is:
```
def compute_reward(self, state, m_power, s_power, terminated):
    ...
```
This function takes in the current state, the main engine power (`m_power`), the side engine power (`s_power`), and a boolean indicating whether the episode has terminated. It returns two values: the overall reward and an individual reward dictionary.

The implementation of this function is not shown, but based on the context, it's likely that the reward is designed to encourage the agent to land safely on the helipad while minimizing the main engine power usage (perhaps with a penalty for using too much power) and optimizing the side engine power usage (e.g., for orientation control).

The individual reward dictionary may contain additional information, such as the fitness score calculated by `compute_fitness_score`, which could be used to evaluate the agent's performance.
