Based on the provided code, I assume that the reward function is implemented in the `compute_reward` method. Here's a possible implementation of the reward function:

```Python
def compute_reward(self, state, m_power, s_power, terminated):
    # Reward for reaching the helipad
    helipad_reward = -100 if abs(state[0]) < 1 and abs(state[1]) < 1 else 0
    
    # Punishment for falling
    fall_punishment = -50 if self.game_over else 0
    
    # Punishment for not being awake (i.e., the lander is not moving)
    idle_punishment = -10 if not self.lander.awake else 0
    
    # Reward for using main engines (m_power > 0)
    main_engine_reward = m_power * 5
    
    # Reward for using side engines (s_power > 0)
    side_engine_reward = s_power * 2
    
    total_reward = helipad_reward + fall_punishment + idle_punishment + main_engine_reward + side_engine_reward
    
    if terminated:
        # Penalty for termination
        total_reward -= 50
    
    return total_reward, {'main_engine': main_engine_reward, 'side_engine': side_engine_reward}
```

In this reward function, we award the agent for reaching the helipad, using main engines to move towards it, and using side engines to correct its orientation. We also penalize the agent for falling or being idle (i.e., not moving). The magnitude of these rewards can be adjusted based on the needs of your specific problem.
