A reinforcement learning problem!

From the given code, I can infer that the reward function is implemented in the `compute_reward` method. Here's a possible representation of the reward function based on the given code:
```python
def compute_reward(state, m_power, s_power, terminated):
    if terminated:  # Game over or out of bounds?
        return -1.0, {}  # Negative reward for termination

    # Compute rewards for main engine (m_power) and side engines (s_power)
    m_engine_reward = np.clip(m_power / MAIN_ENGINE_POWER, 0.0, 1.0)
    s_engine_reward = np.clip(s_power, 0.5, 1.0)

    # Combine main and side engine rewards
    reward = m_engine_reward + s_engine_reward

    return reward, {'main_engine': m_engine_reward, 'side_engines': s_engine_reward}
```
This reward function assigns a positive reward to the agent when it uses its main and side engines effectively (i.e., `m_power` and `s_power` are non-zero). The magnitude of the reward is proportional to the power applied. When the game is terminated or the agent is out of bounds, the reward is negative.

The individual rewards for main and side engines are also returned as a dictionary to provide additional feedback to the agent.
