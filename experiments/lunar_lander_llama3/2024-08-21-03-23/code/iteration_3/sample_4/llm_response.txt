The reward code!

After carefully examining the code, I've identified the reward function as follows:
```python
def compute_reward(self, state, m_power, s_power, terminated):
    # TO DO: Implement your reward function here
    pass
```
This is a placeholder for the actual reward function implementation. The task at hand is to design an effective reward function that guides the agent's learning process in achieving the desired behavior.

From the provided code, I can see that the state vector `state` contains the following components:

1. Lander position (x-axis)
2. Lander position (y-axis)
3. Lander velocity (x-axis)
4. Lander velocity (y-axis)
5. Lander angle
6. Lander angular velocity
7. Contact status of legs 0 and 1

The `m_power` and `s_power` variables seem to be related to the main engine power and side engine power, respectively.

The `terminated` variable indicates whether the episode has ended or not.

Your task is to design a reward function that takes these state components and possibly the `m_power`, `s_power`, and `terminated` variables into account. The goal is to encourage the agent to learn policies that achieve the desired behavior while avoiding unwanted behaviors (e.g., crashing, losing contact with the ground).

Some possible approaches for designing the reward function include:

1. Rewarding progress toward the helipad
2. Punishing crashes or loss of contact with the ground
3. Encouraging smooth landings and stable orientation
4. Fostering efficient use of main and side engines

Your creativity and problem-solving skills will help you design an effective reward function that guides the agent's learning process!
