A reinforcement learning problem!

The reward function is:
```
def compute_reward(self, state, m_power, s_power, terminated):
    # TO DO: implement a suitable reward function
    pass
```
In other words, the reward function is not implemented yet. It's up to you to design a suitable reward function that encourages the agent to achieve the desired behavior in this environment.

Some possible strategies for designing the reward function:

1. **Termination-based reward**: Award a high reward when the episode terminates (e.g., the lander reaches the helipad) and penalize the agent with a negative reward if it crashes or falls off the screen.
2. **Proximity-based reward**: Reward the agent for getting closer to the helipad and penalize it for moving away from it.
3. **Control-based reward**: Award the agent for maintaining control (e.g., keeping the lander's angle close to zero) and penalize it for losing control.

Remember to balance the reward values to ensure that the agent learns effectively. A good starting point is to set the reward values such that they are positive when the agent makes progress towards the goal and negative when it doesn't.
