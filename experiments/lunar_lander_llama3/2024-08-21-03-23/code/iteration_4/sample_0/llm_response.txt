A reinforcement learning problem!

The reward code seems to be defined in the `compute_reward` method. Based on the provided code, I'll try to infer the reward function.

The reward function seems to have three components:

1. The first component might be related to the lander's position, as it checks if `abs(state[0]) >= 1.0`. This could indicate a terminal state or a significant deviation from the desired position.
2. The second component is likely related to the lander's velocity, angle, and angular velocity. It's possible that this component rewards the agent for maintaining a stable or optimal velocity, angle, and angular velocity.
3. The third component might be related to the individual reward, which seems to be an internal reward signal used by the agent.

The `compute_reward` method takes in the following inputs:
* `state`: The current state of the lander (position, velocity, angle, angular velocity, etc.)
* `m_power` and `s_power`: Thrust values for the main engines and side engines, respectively
* `terminated`: A boolean indicating whether the episode has terminated

The method returns a tuple containing two rewards:
* `reward`: The overall reward value
* `individual_reward`: An internal reward signal used by the agent (which also includes the `fitness_score`)

Without more information about the desired behavior and objectives, it's challenging to provide a specific reward function. However, based on this code, I would hypothesize that the reward function is designed to encourage the agent to:
* Maintain stable or optimal velocity, angle, and angular velocity
* Keep the lander close to the target position ( perhaps with some tolerance)
* Avoid terminating episodes prematurely (e.g., by falling off the edge of the platform)

Please let me know if my assumptions are correct or if I'm missing something.
