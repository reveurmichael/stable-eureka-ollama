A reinforcement learning problem!

The reward code looks like this:
```
def compute_reward(self, state, m_power, s_power, terminated):
    # TO DO: define the reward function
    pass
```
This is where you would typically define a reward function that takes in the current state of the environment (in this case, `state`), as well as any relevant information about the agent's actions (`m_power`, `s_power`) and whether the episode has terminated (`terminated`). The goal is to design a reward function that encourages the agent to take certain actions or achieve specific goals.

In this problem, it seems like you want to encourage the lander to successfully land on the helipad while avoiding crashing or running out of fuel. You might consider designing a reward function that assigns positive rewards for making progress towards these goals and negative rewards for failing to do so.

For example:
```
def compute_reward(self, state, m_power, s_power, terminated):
    reward = 0

    if not terminated:  # episode has not yet terminated
        distance_to_helipad = np.linalg.norm(state[:2] - self.helipad)
        reward += -distance_to_helipad  # penalize for being far from helipad

        velocity_magnitude = np.linalg.norm(state[2:4])
        if velocity_magnitude > 0.5:
            reward -= 1  # penalize for high velocity

    else:  # episode has terminated
        if state[0] >= 1.0:  # successfully landed on helipad
            reward += 10
        elif not self.lander.awake:  # crashed or out of fuel
            reward -= 5

    return reward, {}
```
This is just one possible example of a reward function; the actual design will depend on your specific problem and goals.
