The reward function! 

In this case, the reward function `compute_reward` is not explicitly provided. However, based on the context and the variables involved, I can make some educated guesses about how it might be structured.

Here's a possible reflection of the reward function:

```
def compute_reward(self, state, m_power, s_power, terminated):
    if terminated:
        # Game over or out of bounds
        return -10.0, {}  # Termination penalty

    # Reward for successful landing (close to the helipad)
    if abs(state[0]) < 0.5 and self.helipad_y - LEG_DOWN < state[1] < self.helipad_y:
        return 100.0, {'landing_reward': 100.0}

    # Reward for progress towards the helipad (getting closer)
    if state[1] > self.helipad_y:
        return 5.0, {'progress_reward': 5.0}

    # Penalty for falling or getting farther away from the helipad
    if state[1] < self.helipad_y - LEG_DOWN / 2:
        return -20.0, {'falling_penalty': -20.0}

    # Reward for maintaining a good orientation (angle)
    if np.abs(state[4]) < 10.0:
        return 5.0, {'orientation_reward': 5.0}

    # Penalty for poor orientation (large angle)
    if np.abs(state[4]) > 30.0:
        return -10.0, {'poor_orientation_penalty': -10.0}

    # Default reward in case none of the above conditions are met
    return 1.0, {}
```

This reward function takes into account various aspects of the lander's state, such as its position, velocity, angle, and whether it's landed successfully or not. The rewards are designed to encourage the agent to navigate towards the helipad while maintaining a good orientation.

Please note that this is just one possible implementation of the reward function, and you may need to adjust or modify it based on your specific requirements and the behavior of your agent.
