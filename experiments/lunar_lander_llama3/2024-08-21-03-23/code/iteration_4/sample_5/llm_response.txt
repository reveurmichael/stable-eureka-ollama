A reinforcement learning problem!

The reward function seems to be implemented in the `compute_reward` method. Here's what I can deduce from the given code:
```python
def compute_reward(self, state, m_power, s_power, terminated):
    # ... (implementation not shown)
```
Based on the surrounding code, it appears that this method takes in:

1. `state`: a list of 8 values representing the lander's position, velocity, angle, and contact status.
2. `m_main`, `s_power`: possibly related to the main engine and side engines' powers?
3. `terminated`: a boolean indicating whether the episode has terminated.

The method returns two values:

1. `reward`: a scalar value representing the reward for the current state-action pair.
2. `individual_reward`: a dictionary or similar data structure containing additional information about the reward, including `fitness_score`.

Given this context, I'd like to ask: What specific goal would you like me to help you with in terms of designing an effective reward function?
