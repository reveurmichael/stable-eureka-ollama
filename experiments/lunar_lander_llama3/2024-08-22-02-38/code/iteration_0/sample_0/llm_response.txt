Here's an alternative to the initial reward proposal. This new proposal focuses more on incentivizing the agent to land safely and efficiently, while also discouraging excessive use of the main engine.

```
def compute_reward(self, state, m_power, s_power, terminated):
    # Unpack state variables
    x, y, vx, vy, angle, angular_velocity, left_leg, right_leg = state

    # Distance-based reward: incentivize moving towards the landing pad
    distance_reward = -np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    distance_reward = np.exp(distance_reward / 100.0) - 1

    # Angle and velocity rewards: penalize tilting and high velocities
    angle_penalty = -np.abs(angle)
    angle_penalty = np.tanh(angle_penalty / 0.5)

    velocity_penalty = -(np.abs(vx) + np.abs(vy))
    velocity_penalty = np.tanh(velocity_penalty / 1.0)

    # Fuel efficiency reward: penalize using the main engine
    fuel_efficiency_reward = -m_power * (s_power > 0.2)
    fuel_efficiency_reward = np.tanh(fuel_efficiency_reward / 10.0)

    # Landing reward: bonus for successful landing
    landing_reward = 100 if left_leg and right_leg else 0

    # Total reward: a weighted sum of all components
    reward = (distance_reward
              + 0.2 * angle_penalty
              + 0.3 * velocity_penalty
              + 0.5 * fuel_efficiency_reward
              + landing_reward)

    if terminated and not (left_leg and right_leg):
        reward -= 100

    individual_reward = {
        "distance_reward": distance_reward,
        "angle_penalty": angle_penalty,
        "velocity_penalty": velocity_penalty,
        "fuel_efficiency_reward": fuel_efficiency_reward,
        "landing_reward": landing_reward,
    }

    return reward, individual_reward
```

This new proposal aims to provide a more balanced and challenging environment for the agent. It incentivizes efficient use of fuel while also penalizing excessive main engine usage. The distance-based reward is still present, but with a slightly different scaling. The angle and velocity penalties are now weighted equally in the total reward calculation.

Feel free to experiment and adjust this proposal as needed to suit your specific requirements for the lander task!
