Here's a variation of the initial reward proposal:

```
def compute_reward(self, state, m_power, s_power, terminated):
    # Unpack state variables
    x, y, vx, vy, angle, angular_velocity, left_leg, right_leg = state

    # Distance-based reward: incentivize moving towards the landing pad
    distance_reward = -np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    distance_reward = np.exp(distance_reward / 100.0) - 1

    # Angle stability reward: penalize tilting and angular velocity
    angle_stability_penalty = -(np.abs(angle))
    angle_stability_penalty = np.tanh(angle_stability_penalty / 0.5)

    # Velocity stability reward: penalize high velocities
    velocity_stability_penalty = -(np.abs(vx) + np.abs(vy))
    velocity_stability_penalty = np.tanh(velocity_stability_penalty / 1.0)

    # Fuel efficiency reward: incentivize using the side engines
    fuel_efficiency_reward = (m_power + s_power)
    fuel_efficiency_reward /= (1000 + m_power + s_power)  # normalize

    # Landing reward: bonus for successful landing
    landing_reward = 0
    if left_leg and right_leg:
        landing_reward = 100 if abs(x) < 0.1 and abs(y) < 0.1 else 10

    # Total reward: a weighted sum of all components
    reward = (distance_reward
              + 0.2 * angle_stability_penalty
              + 0.3 * velocity_stability_penalty
              + 0.5 * fuel_efficiency_reward
              + landing_reward)

    if terminated:
        reward -= 50

    individual_reward = {
        "distance_reward": distance_reward,
        "angle_stability_penalty": angle_stability_penalty,
        "velocity_stability_penalty": velocity_stability_penalty,
        "fuel_efficiency_reward": fuel_efficiency_reward,
        "landing_reward": landing_reward
    }

    return reward, individual_reward
```

This variation emphasizes the use of side engines and stability during the landing process. The `fuel_efficiency_reward` now incentivizes the use of side engines by normalizing it with respect to the maximum possible power.
