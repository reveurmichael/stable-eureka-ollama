A great challenge!

Here's a variation of the initial reward proposal:

```
def compute_reward(self, state, action, next_state, terminated):
    # Unpack state variables
    x, y, vx, vy, angle, angular_velocity, left_leg, right_leg = state

    # Distance-based reward: incentivize moving towards the landing pad
    distance_reward = -np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    distance_reward = np.exp(distance_reward / 50.0) - 1

    # Stability reward: penalize tilting and angular velocity, but with a smaller penalty for small angles
    angle_penalty = -np.abs(angle)
    angle_penalty = np.tanh(angle_penalty / (0.5 if abs(angle) > 10 else 0.05))

    angular_velocity_penalty = -np.abs(angular_velocity)
    angular_velocity_penalty = np.tanh(angular_velocity_penalty / 0.2)

    # Velocity reward: penalize high velocities, but with a smaller penalty for low velocities
    velocity_penalty = -(np.abs(vx) + np.abs(vy))
    velocity_penalty = np.tanh(velocity_penalty / (1.0 if (vx**2 + vy**2)**0.5 > 5 else 0.5))

    # Fuel efficiency reward: penalize using the main engine, but with a smaller penalty for small actions
    fuel_penalty = -0.5 if action == 2 and abs(action) > 0.1 else 0

    # Landing reward: bonus for successful landing, with a larger bonus for perfect landings
    landing_reward = 0
    if left_leg and right_leg:
        landing_reward = 100 if abs(x) < 0.05 and abs(y) < 0.05 else 50

    # Total reward: a weighted sum of all components
    reward = (distance_reward
              + 0.2 * angle_penalty
              + 0.1 * angular_velocity_penalty
              + 0.4 * velocity_penalty
              + 0.02 * fuel_penalty
              + landing_reward)

    # Apply a penalty if the episode is terminated (crash or out of bounds)
    if terminated and not (left_leg and right_leg):
        reward -= 100

    individual_reward = {
        "distance_reward": distance_reward,
        "angle_penalty": angle_penalty,
        "angular_velocity_penalty": angular_velocity_penalty,
        "velocity_penalty": velocity_penalty,
        "fuel_penalty": fuel_penalty,
        "landing_reward": landing_reward,
    }

    return reward, individual_reward
```

This variation introduces the following changes:

1. **Smoother distance-based reward**: The exponentiation factor is reduced to 50, making the reward curve less steep.
2. **Angle and angular velocity penalties**: The penalty functions are modified to have a smaller slope for small angles/velocities, encouraging more stable flight.
3. **Velocity penalty**: The penalty function is made more gradual, with a smaller slope for low velocities, and a larger slope for high velocities.
4. **Fuel efficiency reward**: The penalty for using the main engine is reduced when the action is small, encouraging more efficient fuel usage.
5. **Landing reward**: The bonus for successful landing is increased, and the condition for perfect landings is made stricter (smaller tolerance).

These changes aim to create a more balanced reward function that encourages the agent to fly stably, efficiently, and safely while approaching the landing pad.
