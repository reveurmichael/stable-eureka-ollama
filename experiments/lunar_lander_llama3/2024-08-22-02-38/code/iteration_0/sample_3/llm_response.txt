Here's a variation of the initial reward proposal:

```
def compute_reward(self, state, action, next_state, terminated):
    # Unpack state variables
    x, y, vx, vy, angle, angular_velocity, left_leg, right_leg = state

    # Distance-based reward: incentivize moving towards the landing pad
    distance_reward = -np.exp(-((x**2 + y**2) / 100.0))

    # Stability reward: penalize tilting and angular velocity
    angle_penalty = np.tanh(np.abs(angle) / 0.5)
    angular_velocity_penalty = np.tanh(np.abs(angular_velocity) / 0.5)

    # Velocity reward: penalize high velocities
    velocity_penalty = -np.exp(-((np.abs(vx) + np.abs(vy)) / 1.0))

    # Fuel efficiency reward: incentivize using the side engines
    fuel_reward = action * 10

    # Landing reward: bonus for successful landing
    landing_reward = 0
    if left_leg and right_leg:
        landing_reward = 100 if abs(x) < 0.1 and abs(y) < 0.1 else 10

    # Total reward: a weighted sum of all components
    reward = (distance_reward * 0.4 + 
              angle_penalty * 0.2 + 
              angular_velocity_penalty * 0.2 + 
              velocity_penalty * 0.1 + 
              fuel_reward * 0.1 + 
              landing_reward)

    # Apply a penalty if the episode is terminated (crash or out of bounds)
    if terminated and not (left_leg and right_leg):
        reward -= 100

    individual_reward = {
        "distance_reward": distance_reward,
        "angle_penalty": angle_penalty,
        "angular_velocity_penalty": angular_velocity_penalty,
        "velocity_penalty": velocity_penalty,
        "fuel_reward": fuel_reward,
        "landing_reward": landing_reward,
    }

    return reward, individual_reward
```

This variation incentivizes the agent to use the side engines by rewarding it for using them and penalizing it for using the main engine. It also adjusts the weights of the distance-based, stability, velocity, and landing rewards to balance their importance in the overall reward function.
