Here's a variation of the initial reward proposal:

```
def compute_reward(self, state, action, next_state, terminated):
    # Unpack state variables
    x, y, vx, vy, angle, angular_velocity, left_leg, right_leg = state

    # Distance-based reward: incentivize moving towards the landing pad
    distance_reward = -np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    distance_reward = np.exp(distance_reward / 100.0) - 1

    # Stability reward: penalize tilting and angular velocity
    angle_penalty = -np.abs(angle)
    angle_penalty = np.tanh(angle_penalty / 0.5)

    angular_velocity_penalty = -np.abs(angular_velocity)
    angular_velocity_penalty = np.tanh(angular_velocity_penalty / 0.5)

    # Velocity reward: penalize high velocities
    velocity_reward = -(vx**2 + vy**2)  # Quadratic penalty for velocity

    # Fuel efficiency reward: incentivize using the side engines
    fuel_reward = -1 if action == 1 else 0  # Incentivize side engine use

    # Landing reward: bonus for successful landing
    landing_reward = 0
    if left_leg and right_leg:
        landing_reward = 100 if abs(x) < 0.1 and abs(y) < 0.1 else 10

    # Total reward: a weighted sum of all components
    reward = (distance_reward
              + 0.2 * angle_penalty
              + 0.15 * angular_velocity_penalty
              + 0.7 * velocity_reward
              + 0.05 * fuel_reward
              + landing_reward)

    # Apply a penalty if the episode is terminated (crash or out of bounds)
    if terminated and not (left_leg and right_leg):
        reward -= 100

    individual_reward = {
        "distance_reward": distance_reward,
        "angle_penalty": angle_penalty,
        "angular_velocity_penalty": angular_velocity_penalty,
        "velocity_reward": velocity_reward,
        "fuel_reward": fuel_reward,
        "landing_reward": landing_reward,
    }

    return reward, individual_reward
```

This variation introduces a quadratic penalty for high velocities (velocity_reward) and incentivizes the use of side engines by providing a small positive reward when they are used. The weights for each component have also been adjusted to reflect the importance of different aspects of the game.

Please note that this is just one possible variation, and you may need to experiment with different rewards to find the right balance for your specific use case.
