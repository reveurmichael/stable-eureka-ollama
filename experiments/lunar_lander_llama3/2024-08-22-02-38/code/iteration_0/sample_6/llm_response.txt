Here's a revised reward function that incorporates some additional features:

```python
def compute_reward(self, state, m_power, s_power, terminated):
    # Unpack state variables
    x, y, vx, vy, angle, angular_velocity, left_leg, right_leg = state

    # Distance-based reward: incentivize moving towards the landing pad
    distance_reward = -np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    distance_reward = np.exp(distance_reward / 100.0) - 1

    # Velocity reward: penalize high velocities and incentivize smooth descent
    velocity_penalty = -(vx**2 + vy**2)  # penalty for high velocity
    velocity_bonus = np.tanh(np.sqrt(vx**2 + vy**2))  # bonus for smooth descent

    # Angle reward: penalize tilting and incentivize stable orientation
    angle_penalty = -np.abs(angle)
    angle_penalty = np.tanh(angle_penalty / 0.5)

    # Fuel efficiency reward: penalize using the main engine and incentivize side engines
    fuel_penalty = -1 if m_power > 0 else 0
    fuel_bonus = s_power * 0.01

    # Landing reward: bonus for successful landing
    landing_reward = 0
    if left_leg and right_leg:
        landing_reward = 100 if abs(x) < 0.1 and abs(y) < 0.1 else 10

    # Total reward: a weighted sum of all components
    reward = (distance_reward
              + 0.2 * velocity_penalty
              + 0.15 * velocity_bonus
              + 0.1 * angle_penalty
              + 0.05 * fuel_penalty
              + 0.05 * fuel_bonus
              + landing_reward)

    # Apply a penalty if the episode is terminated (crash or out of bounds)
    if terminated and not (left_leg and right_leg):
        reward -= 100

    individual_reward = {
        "distance_reward": distance_reward,
        "velocity_penalty": velocity_penalty,
        "velocity_bonus": velocity_bonus,
        "angle_penalty": angle_penalty,
        "fuel_penalty": fuel_penalty,
        "fuel_bonus": fuel_bonus,
        "landing_reward": landing_reward,
    }

    return reward, individual_reward
```

This revised reward function incorporates the following changes:

* The distance-based reward is now more aggressively penalized for being far from the landing pad.
* The velocity reward is modified to incentivize smooth descent while still penalizing high velocities.
* The angle reward is kept similar to the original, but with a slightly increased penalty for tilting.
* The fuel efficiency reward is modified to incentivize using the side engines and penalize using the main engine.
* The landing reward remains unchanged.

These changes aim to make the reward function more robust and effective in guiding the agent towards successful landings.
