Based on the provided code, I would suggest a reward function that encourages the agent to land safely and efficiently. Here's a possible reward design:

```
def compute_reward(state, m_power, s_power, terminated):
    # Reward structure:
    # - Landing penalty: -100 if not landed
    # - Angle penalty: -10 per degree of angle away from horizontal
    # - Velocity penalty: -5 per unit of horizontal velocity (to encourage slower landing)
    # - Vertical position reward: +1 for every 0.2 units above the landing pad (up to a maximum of +20)
    # - Power usage penalty: -0.01 per unit of thrust (to encourage efficient use of power)

    reward = 0

    if terminated:
        if not self.game_over and abs(state[0]) >= 1.0:
            reward -= 100
        else:
            reward -= 50

    reward -= state[4] * 10  # Angle penalty
    reward -= state[2] * 5   # Velocity penalty

    if state[1] > (self.helipad_y + LEG_DOWN / SCALE) / (VIEWPORT_H / SCALE / 2):
        reward += (state[1] - (self.helipad_y + LEG_DOWN / SCALE) / (VIEWPORT_H / SCALE / 2)) * 10
    if state[1] > (self.helipad_y + LEG_DOWN / SCALE) / (VIEWPORT_H / SCALE / 2):
        reward = min(reward, 20)

    reward -= m_power * 0.01 - s_power * 0.01

    return reward, {'m_power': m_power, 's_power': s_power}
```

This reward function aims to encourage the agent to land safely and efficiently by penalizing it for not landing (100), being at an angle away from horizontal (-10 per degree), having high velocity (-5 per unit), and using too much power (-0.01 per unit). The vertical position is rewarded positively (+1 per 0.2 units above the landing pad, up to a maximum of +20).
