Based on the provided code, I can see that you are trying to create a reward function for a reinforcement learning task. The reward function should reflect the desired behavior and incentivize the agent to take certain actions.

From the given code, it seems like the main goal of the lander is to stay within the boundaries of the viewport (VIEWPORT_W/SCALE/2 and VIEWPORT_H/SCALE/2). Additionally, it appears that the agent's legs should be in contact with the ground as much as possible. This suggests that the reward function could be designed such that:

1. The agent receives a positive reward for staying within the boundaries of the viewport.
2. The agent receives a negative or no reward for not having its legs on the ground.

Here is a simple reward function that takes into account these factors:

```
def compute_reward(state, m_power, s_power, terminated):
    if terminated:
        return -10.0, {'terminated': True}

    state_rewards = [
        1.0 + (state[0] ** 2) / ((VIEWPORT_W / SCALE / 2) ** 2),
        1.0 + (state[1] ** 2) / ((VIEWPORT_H / SCALE / 2) ** 2)
    ]
    
    if state[6] == 1.0 and state[7] == 1.0:
        state_rewards.append(1.0)
    else:
        state_rewards.append(-1.0)

    reward = np.sum(state_rewards)
    
    individual_reward = {
        'pos_x': state_rewards[0],
        'pos_y': state_rewards[1],
        'legs_contact': state_rewards[2]
    }
    
    return reward, individual_reward
```

This is a simple example of how you could design the reward function. You may need to adjust it based on your specific requirements and experimentation with different reward functions can help you find one that works well for your task.
