A reinforcement learning problem!

From the given code, I can see that the reward function is not explicitly defined. Instead, there are two separate functions: `compute_reward` and `compute_fitness_score`. These functions seem to be responsible for calculating the reward based on the current state of the environment.

The `compute_reward` function takes in the current state, `m_power`, `s_power`, and a boolean indicating whether the episode is terminated. The `compute_fitness_score` function also takes in these same inputs, but its purpose is not entirely clear from the provided code.

Without more information about the desired behavior of the agent (e.g., what constitutes a good or bad reward), it's difficult to provide a specific reward function. However, I can suggest some possible approaches:

1. **Reward for reaching the helipad**: Provide a positive reward when the agent reaches the helipad and successfully lands.
2. **Penalty for crashing**: Assign a negative reward when the agent crashes or falls off the helipad.
3. **Reward for proximity to the helipad**: Offer a reward based on the distance between the agent's position and the helipad, with closer positions receiving higher rewards.
4. **Combination of above**: Use a combination of these approaches to create a more nuanced reward function.

Here's an example of how you could define the `compute_reward` function:
```python
def compute_reward(state, m_power, s_power, terminated):
    if terminated:
        return -1.0  # penalty for crashing or episode termination
    else:
        pos_diff = abs(state[0])  # distance from helipad
        reward = -pos_diff + 0.5 * (m_power + s_power)  # combination of proximity and engine power
        if state[2] > 0:  # agent is moving forward
            reward += 0.1  # bonus for progress
        return reward
```
This is just a rough example, and you may need to adjust the weights and thresholds based on your specific problem requirements.

Remember to update the `individual_reward` dictionary with the calculated reward value in your main training loop.
