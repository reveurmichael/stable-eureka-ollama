Here's a possible reward function based on the provided code and problem statement. The reward function should aim to guide the lander to touch down safely on the helipad.

```
def compute_reward(self, state, m_power, s_power, terminated):
    # Reward for landing safely
    if not terminated:
        reward = -1.0  # penalty for not having landed yet

    elif abs(state[0]) < 0.5:  # within the safe zone (0.5 units from the center)
        reward = 1.0  # positive reward for a successful landing
    else:
        reward = -10.0  # severe penalty for crashing or going outside the safe zone

    if terminated and abs(state[0]) < 0.5:  # bonus for successful landing after crash
        individual_reward = {"bonus": 1.0}
    elif terminated and abs(state[0]) >= 0.5:  # penalty for crash
        individual_reward = {"penalty": -10.0}

    else:
        individual_reward = {}

    return reward, individual_reward
```

This reward function provides a negative reward (-1.0) while the lander is still in the air, encouraging it to touch down safely as soon as possible. If the lander has crashed or gone outside the safe zone (i.e., `terminated` is True), it receives a severe penalty of -10.0. A successful landing within the safe zone earns a positive reward of 1.0.
