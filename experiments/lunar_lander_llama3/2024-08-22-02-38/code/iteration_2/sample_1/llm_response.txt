Based on the provided environment and the way the lander is being controlled, I would suggest a reward function that encourages the agent to successfully land the lander. Here's a possible implementation:

```
def compute_reward(self, state, m_power, s_power, terminated):
    reward = -1  # penalty for not landing

    if not terminated:
        # distance from the desired position
        pos_diff = abs(state[0]) + abs(state[1])
        # penalize the agent for being far away
        reward -= pos_diff / 2.0

        # velocity difference from the desired velocity
        vel_diff = (abs(state[2])) + (abs(state[3]))
        # penalize the agent for having high velocities
        reward -= vel_diff / 5.0

        # orientation of the lander
        if state[4] > -1.57:  # within a certain range, say pi/2 radians
            reward += 0.5

    else:
        # if the lander has landed successfully, give it a positive reward
        reward = 10.0

    return reward, {'pos_diff': pos_diff, 'vel_diff': vel_diff}
```

This reward function encourages the agent to control the lander's position and velocity while keeping its orientation within a certain range. The closer the lander gets to the desired position and the lower its velocities are, the higher the reward will be. If the lander lands successfully, it receives a large positive reward.

The individual_reward dictionary contains information about the penalty components (position difference and velocity difference) that can help in debugging or analyzing the agent's performance.
