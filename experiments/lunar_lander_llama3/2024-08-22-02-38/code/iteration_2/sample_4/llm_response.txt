Based on the provided code, I would assume that the reward function is to keep the lander alive and close to the helipad. The reward could be a combination of these factors:

1. Alive: If the lander is still alive (i.e., not game over), add a positive reward.
2. Distance from Helipad: Reward the agent for being closer to the helipad. This could be achieved by subtracting some penalty function that increases with distance.

Here's a possible implementation:
```
def compute_reward(self, state, m_power, s_power, terminated):
    reward = 0

    # Alive
    if not self.game_over:
        reward += 1.0

    # Distance from Helipad
    distance_penalty = np.abs(state[0]) + np.abs(state[1])
    reward -= 0.1 * distance_penalty

    return reward, {'alive': 1.0 if not self.game_over else 0.0, 'distance_penalty': distance_penalty}
```
This reward function is simple and may need to be adjusted based on experimentation with different values of the reward parameters.
