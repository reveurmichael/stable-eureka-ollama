A reinforcement learning problem!

After analyzing the provided code, I'll attempt to reflect on the reward design.

**Observations**

1. The reward function seems to be influenced by the state of the lander (position, velocity, angle, and angular velocity) and the actions taken (main engine thrust, side engine thrust).
2. The `compute_reward` method takes in the current state, main engine power (`m_power`), side engine power (`s_power`), and termination status as inputs.
3. The reward is computed based on some unknown function(s).

**Questions**

1. What are the specific goals or objectives that the lander should achieve to maximize the reward? (e.g., reaching a target position, maintaining a stable orientation, etc.)
2. Are there any penalties for undesired actions, such as crashing into the ground or losing too much altitude?
3. Is there an optimal trajectory or set of actions that the lander should follow to maximize the reward?

**Hypotheses**

1. The reward function might be designed to encourage the lander to maintain a stable orientation and velocity while minimizing energy consumption.
2. There could be a penalty for crashing or losing too much altitude, which would discourage the lander from taking actions that result in these outcomes.

**Reward Reflection**

Based on my observations, questions, and hypotheses, I propose the following reward reflection:

The reward function is designed to encourage the lander to maintain a stable orientation and velocity while minimizing energy consumption. The main engine thrust (`m_power`) affects the lander's velocity and altitude, while the side engine thrust (`s_power`) influences its orientation.

A possible reward structure could be:

1. **Position-based reward**: Encourage the lander to reach and stabilize at a target position (e.g., the helipad).
2. **Orientation-based reward**: Reward the lander for maintaining a stable orientation, with penalties for large deviations from a desired angle.
3. **Velocity-based reward**: Encourage the lander to maintain a stable velocity while minimizing energy consumption.

These components could be combined and weighted to create a comprehensive reward function that incentivizes the lander to achieve the desired objectives.

Please note that this is just an educated guess, and the actual reward function might be more complex or have different design goals.
