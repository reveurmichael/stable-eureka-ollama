Based on the provided code, I would suggest a reward function that takes into account the following aspects:

1. Landing safely: A high reward for successfully landing the lander on the helipad.
2. Angle and velocity: Reward the agent for maintaining a stable angle and low velocity at the end of each episode.
3. Legs in contact with the ground: Encourage the agent to keep its legs in contact with the ground as much as possible.

Here's an example reward function:

```
def compute_reward(state, m_power, s_power, terminated):
    reward = 0.0
    if not terminated:
        # Landing safely
        reward += -abs(state[0])  # penalize distance from center

        # Angle and velocity
        reward -= abs(state[3])  # penalize x-velocity
        reward -= abs(state[4])  # penalize angle

        # Legs in contact with the ground
        if state[6] == 1.0:
            reward += 0.5  # reward for having one leg on the ground
        if state[7] == 1.0:
            reward += 0.5  # reward for having the other leg on the ground

    else:
        # Game over, penalize
        reward -= 10.0

    individual_reward = {'m_power': m_power, 's_power': s_power}
    return reward, individual_reward
```

This reward function aims to balance the different aspects mentioned above and encourages the agent to land safely while maintaining a stable angle and velocity. The exact values of the rewards can be adjusted based on the specific requirements of your problem.
