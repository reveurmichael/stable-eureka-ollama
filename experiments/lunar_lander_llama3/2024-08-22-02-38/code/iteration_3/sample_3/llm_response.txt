Based on the given environment and actions, I would design a reward function that reflects the goal of the lander to stay upright and reach the helipad while minimizing the use of thrusters. Here's a possible reward reflection:

```
def compute_reward(state, m_power, s_power, terminated):
    # Define constants for the reward
    REWARD_UPRIGHT = 1.0
    REWARD_HELIPAD = 10.0
    PENALTY_DOWN = -2.0
    PENALTY_FAR = -1.0
    PENALTY_HIGH_FUEL = -5.0

    # Calculate the reward based on the state
    reward = 0.0

    if terminated:
        return 0.0, {}

    # Reward for staying upright
    if abs(state[3]) < 0.1:  # Lander is almost at rest
        reward += REWARD_UPRIGHT

    # Reward for reaching the helipad
    if state[1] > 0.5 and abs(state[0]) < 0.2:  # Lander is near the helipad
        reward += REWARD_HELIPAD

    # Penalty for falling down
    if state[1] < -0.8:
        reward -= PENALTY_DOWN

    # Penalty for being too far from the helipad
    if abs(state[0]) > 0.4 or abs(state[1]) > 0.2:
        reward -= PENALTY_FAR

    # Penalty for high fuel consumption
    if m_power + s_power > 5.0:  # Lander has used too much fuel
        reward -= PENALTY_HIGH_FUEL

    return reward, {'upright': REWARD_UPRIGHT * (1 - abs(state[3]) / 0.1),
                    'helipad': REWARD_HELIPAD * (1 - max(0, min(1, state[1] - 0.5))),
                    'down': PENALTY_DOWN * (abs(state[1]) + 0.8),
                    'far': PENALTY_FAR * max(1 - abs(state[0]), 0) * max(1 - abs(state[1]), 0),
                    'high_fuel': PENALTY_HIGH_FUEL * (m_power + s_power - 5.0)}
```

This reward function rewards the lander for staying upright, reaching the helipad, and using fuel efficiently. It penalizes the lander for falling down, being too far from the helipad, or using too much fuel. The individual reward component is designed to provide more detailed feedback on the different aspects of the lander's performance.
