A reinforcement learning problem!

To create a reward function that has an impact on the physics, I'll focus on designing a reward scheme that encourages the agent to learn effective control policies for landing the lander safely.

Here's my proposed reward function:

```
def compute_reward(state, m_power, s_power, terminated):
    # Positive reward for being close to the target position and orientation
    pos_reward = np.exp(-((state[0] - 0.5) ** 2 + (state[1] - 0.5) ** 2) / (VIEWPORT_W / SCALE / 2) ** 2)
    orient_reward = np.cos(state[4])

    # Penalty for falling or crashing
    fall_penalty = -100 if terminated and abs(state[0]) >= 1.0 else 0

    # Bonus for using the main engines wisely (i.e., not wasting thrust)
    m_power_bonus = 10 * s_power if np.abs(action[0]) > 0.5 else 0

    # Side engine bonus for adjusting orientation
    s_power_bonus = 20 * np.abs(s_power) if np.abs(action[1]) > 0.5 else 0

    reward = pos_reward + orient_reward + m_power_bonus + s_power_bonus - fall_penalty
    return reward, individual_reward
```

This reward function encourages the agent to:

1. Stay close to the target position (x, y) and orientation (angle).
2. Avoid falling or crashing by penalizing large deviations from the target.
3. Use the main engines efficiently by rewarding moderate thrust levels.
4. Adjust the side engines to orient the lander correctly.

The reward is a weighted sum of these components, with the weights adjusted to balance the importance of each aspect.

Note that this is just one possible approach, and you may need to adjust or modify the reward function based on your specific problem requirements and performance metrics.
