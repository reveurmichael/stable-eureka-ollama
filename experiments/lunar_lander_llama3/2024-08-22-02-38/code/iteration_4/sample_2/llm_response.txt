Based on the provided code, I would suggest a reward function that reflects the agent's performance in the physics-based environment. Here's a possible implementation:

```
def compute_reward(self, state, m_power, s_power, terminated):
    # Define the reward structure
    individual_reward = {'m_power': 0.0, 's_power': 0.0}

    if not terminated:
        # Reward for moving towards the helipad (pos.x)
        pos_x = state[0]
        m_reward = -abs(pos_x)  # Negative reward for being far from the helipad

        # Reward for vertical position (pos.y)
        pos_y = state[1]
        if pos_y > 0.5:  # Lander is close to the ground
            m_reward += 10.0
        elif pos_y < -0.5:  # Lander is too high in the air
            m_reward -= 20.0

        individual_reward['m_power'] = m_reward

    if s_power > 0:
        # Reward for using side engines (orientation)
        orientation_reward = 10.0 * np.clip(s_power, 0.5, 1.0)  # Positive reward for correct orientation
        individual_reward['s_power'] = orientation_reward
    else:
        individual_reward['s_power'] = -10.0  # Penalty for not using side engines

    if terminated:
        individual_reward['m_power'] -= 100.0  # Termination penalty

    return m_reward, individual_reward
```

This reward function aims to encourage the agent to:

1. Move towards the helipad (higher rewards for being closer)
2. Maintain a safe altitude (rewards for being close to the ground or not too high in the air)
3. Use side engines correctly (orientation) by providing positive rewards for correct orientation and penalties for incorrect orientation
4. Avoid termination conditions (game over, etc.) by assigning a penalty when terminated

Note that this is just one possible implementation of a reward function, and you may need to adjust or modify it based on your specific problem and environment.
