A reinforcement learning problem!

Given the physics-based environment and the agent's actions, I'll outline a potential reward function that encourages the lander to successfully land on the helipad. Here's my reflection:

**Reward structure:**

1. **Success bonus**: A large positive reward when the lander lands safely on the helipad (e.g., `+100`).
2. **Crash penalty**: A significant negative reward when the lander crashes or falls off the platform (e.g., `-50`).
3. **Penalty for deviating from optimal trajectory**: A smaller negative reward if the lander's position or velocity deviates significantly from the ideal landing path.
4. **Reward for proximity to the helipad**: A small positive reward when the lander is close to the helipad (e.g., `+1` per unit of distance).
5. **Penalty for using too much fuel**: A negative reward if the lander uses excessive fuel during the landing process.

**Reward calculation:**

Given the current state (`state`) and the terminated status (`terminated`), calculate the reward as follows:

```python
def compute_reward(state, m_power, s_power, terminated):
    reward = 0.0

    # Success bonus (if landed safely)
    if not terminated:
        reward += +100.0

    # Crash penalty (if crashed or fell off)
    elif terminated and abs(state[0]) >= 1.0:  # crashed or fell off
        reward -= 50.0

    # Penalty for deviating from optimal trajectory
    distance_to_helipad = abs(state[0] - VIEWPORT_W / SCALE / 2) + abs(state[1] - (self.helipad_y + LEG_DOWN / SCALE))
    if not terminated:
        reward -= 0.5 * distance_to_helipad

    # Reward for proximity to the helipad
    if not terminated and distance_to_helipad < 10:  # within a reasonable distance from the helipad
        reward += 1.0 / (distance_to_helipad + 1)

    # Penalty for using too much fuel
    total_power = m_power + s_power
    if not terminated:
        reward -= 0.01 * total_power

    return reward, {'m_power': m_power, 's_power': s_power}
```

**Individual reward:**

The individual reward dictionary (`individual_reward`) will contain the `m_power` and `s_power` values used during the episode.

This reward function is designed to encourage the lander to successfully land on the helipad while minimizing fuel consumption. The success bonus and crash penalty provide strong incentives for the agent to learn from its experiences.
