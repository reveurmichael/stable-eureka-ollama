I'd be happy to help you with that. However, I need more information about how your reward function should behave in this scenario.

From what I can gather from the provided code, it seems like you are trying to create a reward function for an reinforcement learning task where the goal is to control a lander object to safely touch down on a surface. 

Here's a possible implementation of the reward function based on your problem:

```
def compute_reward(self, state, m_power, s_power, terminated):
    # Define rewards and penalties
    REWARD_TOUCHDOWN = 1000
    PENALTY_CRASH = -500
    PENALTY_ORIENTATION = -10
    PENALTY_VERTICAL_SPEED = -5

    # Calculate the reward based on the current state
    reward = 0
    if terminated:
        if state[7] == 1 and state[6] == 1:  # Landed safely
            reward += REWARD_TOUCHDOWN
        else:
            reward += PENALTY_CRASH
    else:
        orientation_penalty = -abs(state[4])
        vertical_speed_penalty = -state[2]
        if m_power > 0 and s_power > 0:
            reward -= PENALTY_ORIENTATION + PENALTY_VERTICAL_SPEED
        elif m_power == 0 and s_power == 0:
            reward += 5

    return reward, {'orientation': orientation_penalty, 'vertical_speed': vertical_speed_penalty}
```

In this code:

- `REWARD_TOUCHDOWN` is the reward for successfully landing.
- `PENALTY_CRASH` is the penalty for crashing.
- `PENALTY_ORIENTATION` and `PENALTY_VERTICAL_SPEED` are penalties for not having a good orientation and vertical speed, respectively.

The reward function calculates these values based on the current state of the lander. If the lander has landed safely (both legs in contact with the ground), it gets a high reward. If it crashes, it gets a penalty. If it's in the air and hasn't crashed yet, it gets penalties for not having a good orientation and vertical speed.
