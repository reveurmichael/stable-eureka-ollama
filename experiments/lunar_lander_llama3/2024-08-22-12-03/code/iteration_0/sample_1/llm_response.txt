Here's an alternative reward function based on the initial proposal:

```
def compute_reward(self, state, m_power, s_power, terminated):
    # Unpack state variables
    x, y, vx, vy, angle, angular_velocity, left_leg, right_leg = state

    # Distance-based reward: incentivize moving towards the landing pad
    distance_reward = -np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)

    # Velocity reward: penalize high velocities and encourage steady descent
    velocity_penalty = -(vx**2 + vy**2)
    velocity_penalty = np.tanh(velocity_penalty / 1.0)

    # Fuel efficiency reward: penalize using the main engine and side engines
    fuel_penalty = -m_power if m_power > 0 else 0
    fuel_penalty += -s_power * (abs(vx) + abs(vy))
    fuel_penalty = np.tanh(fuel_penalty / 1.0)

    # Landing reward: bonus for successful landing
    landing_reward = 0
    if left_leg and right_leg:
        landing_reward = 100 if abs(x) < 0.1 and abs(y) < 0.1 else 10

    # Total reward: a weighted sum of all components
    reward = (distance_reward
              + 0.2 * velocity_penalty
              + 0.4 * fuel_penalty
              + landing_reward)

    # Apply a penalty if the episode is terminated (crash or out of bounds)
    if terminated and not (left_leg and right_leg):
        reward -= 100

    individual_reward = {
        "distance_reward": distance_reward,
        "velocity_penalty": velocity_penalty,
        "fuel_penalty": fuel_penalty,
        "landing_reward": landing_reward,
    }

    return reward, individual_reward
```

In this alternative reward function, I've made the following changes:

* The distance-based reward is now solely based on the Euclidean distance from the lander to the landing pad, without any exponential decay.
* The velocity penalty has been modified to penalize high velocities and encourage steady descent. This should incentivize the agent to slow down its movement towards the landing pad.
* The fuel efficiency reward has been updated to penalize both main engine usage (m_power) and side engine usage (s_power). This should encourage the agent to use side engines more efficiently.

These changes aim to provide a more nuanced reward function that balances distance, velocity, and fuel efficiency.
