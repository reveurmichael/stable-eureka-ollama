Here's an alternative reward function that incentivizes the lander to move towards the landing pad while maintaining stability and fuel efficiency:

```
def compute_reward(self, state, action, next_state, terminated):
    # Unpack state variables
    x, y, vx, vy, angle, angular_velocity, left_leg, right_leg = state

    # Distance-based reward: incentivize moving towards the landing pad
    distance_reward = -np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)  # negative because we want to move closer
    distance_reward *= (1 - abs(angle) / np.pi)  # penalize tilting away from the target direction

    # Stability reward: penalize tilting and angular velocity
    angle_penalty = -np.abs(angle)
    angular_velocity_penalty = -np.abs(angular_velocity)

    # Velocity reward: penalize high velocities, especially if not moving towards the landing pad
    velocity_penalty = -(np.abs(vx) + np.abs(vy))
    if abs(x) > 0.1 or abs(y) > 0.1:
        velocity_penalty *= (1 - abs(angle) / np.pi)

    # Fuel efficiency reward: penalize using the main engine, especially during landing
    fuel_penalty = -1 if action == 2 else 0
    if left_leg and right_leg:
        fuel_penalty *= (1 - np.sqrt((x - 0.05)**2 + (y - 0.05)**2) / 0.5)

    # Landing reward: bonus for successful landing
    landing_reward = 100 if abs(x) < 0.01 and abs(y) < 0.01 else 10

    # Total reward: a weighted sum of all components
    reward = (distance_reward
              + 0.2 * angle_penalty
              + 0.1 * angular_velocity_penalty
              + 0.3 * velocity_penalty
              + 0.05 * fuel_penalty
              + landing_reward)

    # Apply a penalty if the episode is terminated (crash or out of bounds)
    if terminated and not (left_leg and right_leg):
        reward -= 100

    individual_reward = {
        "distance_reward": distance_reward,
        "angle_penalty": angle_penalty,
        "angular_velocity_penalty": angular_velocity_penalty,
        "velocity_penalty": velocity_penalty,
        "fuel_penalty": fuel_penalty,
        "landing_reward": landing_reward,
    }

    return reward, individual_reward
```

This alternative reward function encourages the lander to move towards the landing pad while maintaining stability and fuel efficiency. The distance-based reward is adjusted based on the angle of the lander, penalizing tilting away from the target direction. The velocity penalty is also adjusted based on the distance from the landing pad, penalizing high velocities when not moving towards the target.
