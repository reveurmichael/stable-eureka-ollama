Here's a variation of the initial reward proposal:

```
def compute_reward(self, state, action, next_state, terminated):
    # Unpack state variables
    x, y, vx, vy, angle, angular_velocity, left_leg, right_leg = state

    # Distance-based reward: incentivize moving towards the landing pad
    distance_reward = -np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    distance_reward = np.exp(distance_reward / 100.0) - 1

    # Stability reward: penalize tilting and angular velocity, but make it more forgiving at the end
    angle_penalty = -np.abs(angle)
    if abs(angle) > 20:
        angle_penalty *= 2
    else:
        angle_penalty /= 2

    angular_velocity_penalty = -np.abs(angular_velocity)
    if np.abs(angular_velocity) > 5:
        angular_velocity_penalty *= 2
    else:
        angular_velocity_penalty /= 2

    # Velocity reward: penalize high velocities, but make it more forgiving at the end
    velocity_penalty = -(np.abs(vx) + np.abs(vy))
    if np.sqrt(vx**2 + vy**2) > 10:
        velocity_penalty *= 2
    else:
        velocity_penalty /= 2

    # Fuel efficiency reward: penalize using the main engine, but make it more forgiving at the end
    fuel_penalty = -1 if action == 2 else 0
    if terminated and not (left_leg and right_leg):
        fuel_penalty *= 10

    # Landing reward: bonus for successful landing, with a higher value for perfect landings
    landing_reward = 100 if left_leg and right_leg and abs(x) < 0.1 and abs(y) < 0.1 else 20

    # Total reward: a weighted sum of all components
    reward = (distance_reward
              + 0.2 * angle_penalty
              + 0.2 * angular_velocity_penalty
              + 0.4 * velocity_penalty
              + 0.01 * fuel_penalty
              + landing_reward)

    # Apply a penalty if the episode is terminated (crash or out of bounds)
    if terminated and not (left_leg and right_leg):
        reward -= 100

    individual_reward = {
        "distance_reward": distance_reward,
        "angle_penalty": angle_penalty,
        "angular_velocity_penalty": angular_velocity_penalty,
        "velocity_penalty": velocity_penalty,
        "fuel_penalty": fuel_penalty,
        "landing_reward": landing_reward,
    }

    return reward, individual_reward
```

This variation provides a more forgiving penalty for the main engine usage and velocity as the episode progresses. It also adds a higher bonus for perfect landings and reduces the penalty for the agent being terminated if it has successfully landed.
