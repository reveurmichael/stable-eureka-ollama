Here's a variation of the initial reward proposal. This new proposal emphasizes the importance of landing safely and efficiently, while still providing rewards for moving towards the landing pad.

```
def compute_reward(self, state, action, next_state, terminated):
    # Unpack state variables
    x, y, vx, vy, angle, angular_velocity, left_leg, right_leg = state

    # Distance-based reward: incentivize moving towards the landing pad
    distance_reward = -np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    distance_reward = np.exp(distance_reward / 100.0) - 1

    # Stability reward: penalize tilting and angular velocity
    angle_penalty = -np.abs(angle)
    angle_penalty = np.tanh(angle_penalty / 0.5)

    angular_velocity_penalty = -np.abs(angular_velocity)
    angular_velocity_penalty = np.tanh(angular_velocity_penalty / 0.5)

    # Velocity reward: penalize high velocities
    velocity_penalty = -(np.abs(vx) + np.abs(vy))
    velocity_penalty = np.tanh(velocity_penalty / 1.0)

    # Fuel efficiency reward: incentivize using the side engines
    fuel_reward = -1 if action == 2 else 0.5

    # Landing reward: bonus for successful landing
    landing_reward = 0
    if left_leg and right_leg:
        landing_reward = 100 if abs(x) < 0.1 and abs(y) < 0.1 else 10

    # Total reward: a weighted sum of all components
    reward = (distance_reward
              + 0.2 * angle_penalty
              + 0.3 * angular_velocity_penalty
              + 0.4 * velocity_penalty
              + 0.05 * fuel_reward
              + landing_reward)

    # Apply a penalty if the episode is terminated (crash or out of bounds)
    if terminated and not (left_leg and right_leg):
        reward -= 100

    individual_reward = {
        "distance_reward": distance_reward,
        "angle_penalty": angle_penalty,
        "angular_velocity_penalty": angular_velocity_penalty,
        "velocity_penalty": velocity_penalty,
        "fuel_reward": fuel_reward,
        "landing_reward": landing_reward,
    }

    return reward, individual_reward
```

In this variation, the fuel efficiency reward is now incentivizing the use of side engines by giving a small positive reward for using them (0.5) and penalizing the main engine (1). The total reward is also adjusted to prioritize stability, velocity, and landing over distance-based rewards.
