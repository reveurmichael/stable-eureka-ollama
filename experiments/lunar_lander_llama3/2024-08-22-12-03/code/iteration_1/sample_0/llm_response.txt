A reward engineer's dream!

After analyzing the code, I've identified the reward function. It's defined in the `compute_reward` method, which takes in the following inputs:

1. `state`: A list of 8 elements representing the lander's position, velocity, angle, and contact with the ground.
2. `m_power` and `s_power`: The magnitudes of the main engine and side engines, respectively.

The reward function seems to be designed to encourage the agent to:

1. Land safely on the helipad (high reward for successful landing)
2. Maintain a stable orientation (high reward for small angle changes)
3. Minimize the distance from the lander's initial position (penalty for moving away from the starting point)

Here's my interpretation of the reward function:
```python
def compute_reward(state, m_power, s_power, terminated):
    # Landing reward (1.0 if successful, 0.5 otherwise)
    landing_reward = 1.0 if not terminated and abs(state[0]) < 1.0 else 0.5

    # Orientation reward (1.0 if angle change is small, 0.0 otherwise)
    orientation_reward = 1.0 if abs(state[4] - initial_angle) < 0.1 else 0.0

    # Distance penalty (higher values for moving away from the starting point)
    distance_penalty = 1.0 - (state[0] ** 2 + state[1] ** 2) / (VIEWPORT_W ** 2 + VIEWPORT_H ** 2)

    reward = landing_reward + orientation_reward - distance_penalty
    individual_reward = {"landing": landing_reward, "orientation": orientation_reward, "distance": distance_penalty}

    return reward, individual_reward
```
Please note that this is my interpretation of the code. I might have missed some details or made incorrect assumptions.
