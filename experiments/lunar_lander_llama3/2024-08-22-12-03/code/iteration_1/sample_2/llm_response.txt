I'd be happy to help with that!

Here's a possible implementation for the `compute_reward` function based on the provided physics code:

```
def compute_reward(self, state, m_power, s_power, terminated):
    # Define the rewards
    REWARDmain_engine = -0.1  # penalty for main engine usage
    REWARDSide_engine = -0.05  # penalty for side engine usage
    
    # Calculate the reward based on the state and actions taken
    reward = 0.0
    if not terminated:
        # Penalty for using the main engine
        reward -= m_power * REWARDmain_engine
        
        # Penalty for using the side engines
        reward -= s_power * REWARDSide_engine
        
        # Reward for being close to the target position (x-coordinate)
        reward += state[0] * 0.5
        
    return reward, {'main_engine': m_power, 'side_engine': s_power}
```

This reward function is designed to encourage the agent to:

1. Avoid using the main engine by penalizing it with a negative reward.
2. Avoid using the side engines as well by penalizing them slightly less than the main engine.
3. Approach the target position (x-coordinate) by giving it a positive reward for being close.

Note that this is just one possible implementation, and you may need to adjust the reward function based on your specific problem requirements.
