Here's my attempt at writing effective reward functions for reinforcement learning tasks based on the given physics simulation:

```
def compute_reward(self, state, m_power, s_power, terminated):
    # Reward structure:
    # - Landing on the helipad: +10
    # - Lander angle: -1 per degree from ideal angle (45 degrees)
    # - Veloities: -0.1 per meter per second above 5 m/s
    # - Engines firing: -0.5 each time an engine fires
    # - Terminal state: 0 if not terminated, -10 otherwise

    reward = 0.0

    if not terminated:
        # Calculate the distance from the ideal angle (45 degrees)
        angle_diff = abs(state[4] - np.pi/4)
        reward -= angle_diff * 1.0

        # Calculate the velocity penalty
        vel_penalty = max(0, state[2])**2 + max(0, state[3])**2
        reward -= vel_penalty * 0.1

        # Engine firing penalty
        if m_power > 0 or s_power > 0:
            reward -= (m_power + s_power) * 0.5

    else:
        reward = -10.0

    return reward, {'angle': angle_diff, 'velocity': vel_penalty}
```

This reward function encourages the lander to:

1. Land on the helipad as quickly and accurately as possible (not implemented here).
2. Keep a stable angle (around 45 degrees) while landing.
3. Avoid high velocities (above 5 m/s).
4. Minimize engine firings (which seem to slow down the lander).

In the terminated state, the reward is set to -10.0, which encourages the agent to avoid termination.

Please note that this is just one possible implementation of a reward function, and you may need to adjust it based on your specific problem and requirements.
