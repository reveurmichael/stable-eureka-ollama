A reinforcement learning task!

The reward function seems to be a combination of several components. Here's my attempt at reflecting on the reward code:

1. **Main engine reward**: The main engine power (`m_power`) seems to be rewarded when it's used effectively, as indicated by the `m_power` value.
2. **Side engine reward**: The side engines (`s_power`) are also rewarded when they're used, particularly when the lander is moving in a specific direction (indicated by `ox` and `oy`). This suggests that the side engines are used to control the lander's orientation and movement.
3. **Position-based reward**: The position of the lander (`pos.x` and `pos.y`) seems to be rewarded when it's close to the target location (the helipad). This could be related to the `VIEWPORT_W` and `VIEWPORT_H` constants, which suggest a visual representation.
4. **Velocity-based reward**: The velocity of the lander (`vel.x` and `vel.y`) also seems to be rewarded when it's moving in a certain direction or speed.
5. **Angle-based reward**: The angle of the lander (`self.lander.angle`) might also be rewarded, potentially indicating that the lander is facing the correct direction.
6. **Angular velocity-based reward**: The angular velocity of the lander (`self.lander.angularVelocity`) could be related to the stability or momentum of the lander.

The `compute_reward` function takes in the current state (`state`), main engine power (`m_power`), side engine power (`s_power`), and a termination flag (`terminated`). It returns both a total reward and an individual reward. The `fitness_score` computation seems to be related to the overall performance of the lander.

Overall, the reward function appears to encourage the agent to:

* Use main and side engines effectively
* Position itself correctly (near the helipad)
* Maintain a stable velocity
* Face the correct direction (angle)
* Build momentum through angular velocity

The exact weights and scaling factors will depend on the specific problem domain and desired behavior.
