Here's a simple and intuitive reward function that can be used for reinforcement learning tasks. 

For this specific problem, we want to encourage the agent (lander) to stay close to the center of the lander and avoid falling. Here's how we can define our reward:

1. **Penalty for height**: The higher the lander is from the ground, the worse it is. Let's assign a negative reward when the lander is above a certain height.
2. **Reward for proximity to center**: When the lander is close to the center of the landing pad, it should be rewarded.
3. **Penalty for falling**: If the lander falls or is about to fall (i.e., its vertical speed is negative and increasing), we should penalize it.

Here's the reward function in Python:

```
def compute_reward(state, m_power, s_power, terminated):
    # Define some constants
    MAX_HEIGHT = 10.0  # The maximum height the lander can be before falling
    CENTER_PROXIMITY_REWARD = 1.0
    FALLING_PENALTY = -5.0

    # Calculate the reward based on the state and terminated status
    if terminated or abs(state[0]) >= 1.0:  # If the lander has fallen or is too far away
        return FALLING_PENALTY, {'height': -state[0], 'velocity': -state[2]}
    elif state[0] > MAX_HEIGHT:  # If the lander is above the maximum height
        return -CENTER_PROXIMITY_REWARD, {'height': -state[0], 'velocity': -state[2]}
    else:
        proximity_reward = CENTER_PROXIMITY_REWARD * (1.0 - abs(state[0]))
        if state[2] > 0:  # If the lander is still falling
            return -CENTER_PROXIMITY_REWARD, {'height': -state[0], 'velocity': -state[2]}
        else:
            return proximity_reward, {'height': state[1], 'velocity': state[2]}
```

This reward function takes into account the lander's height, velocity, and position relative to the center of the landing pad.
