A reinforcement learning problem!

The reward function is a crucial component in reinforcement learning, as it provides feedback to the agent on its actions. Based on the provided code, I'll try to infer the reward structure.

From what I can see, there are two types of rewards:

1. **Individual Reward**: This is calculated by the `compute_reward` method, which takes in the current state, main engine power (`m_power`), side engine power (`s_power`), and whether the episode has terminated.
2. **Fitness Score**: This is computed separately using the `compute_fitness_score` method, also taking in the state, main engine power, side engine power, and termination status.

The reward structure might be something like this:

* The individual reward is designed to encourage the agent to:
	+ Use the main engines to move the lander forward (positive reward for `m_power`)?
	+ Use the side engines to adjust the lander's orientation (positive reward for `s_power`)?
	+ Keep the lander away from the edge of the screen (negative reward for `abs(state[0]) >= 1.0`)? 
* The fitness score is designed to evaluate the agent's overall performance, possibly taking into account factors like:
	+ Distance traveled or speed achieved with the main engines?
	+ Orientation and stability maintained with the side engines?
	+ Avoidance of obstacles or termination conditions?

The reward function is not explicitly defined, but I'm assuming it combines these individual rewards and fitness scores to shape the agent's behavior.

Please correct me if I'm wrong!
