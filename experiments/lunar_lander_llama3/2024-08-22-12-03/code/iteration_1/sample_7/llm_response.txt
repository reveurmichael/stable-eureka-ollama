Based on the provided code, I can infer that the reward function is designed to promote survival and successful landing. Here's my attempt at breaking down the reward reflection:

The `compute_reward` method seems to be structured around two main components: individual rewards for the lander's state and a termination bonus.

1. **State-based rewards**: The first part of the reward might be related to the lander's position (`state[0]`) and velocity (`state[2]`). If the lander is close to the center of the viewport (`state[0]` near 0), it might receive a positive reward. Conversely, if it strays far from the center (`state[0]` >= 1.0), the reward could be penalized.

2. **Termination bonus**: If the episode has terminated (i.e., `self.game_over` is `True` or `abs(state[0]) >= 1.0`), the agent receives a termination bonus to encourage it to avoid crashing.

The individual rewards for the lander's state, position, and velocity could be updated based on these conditions. For example:

- `reward = -10 * abs(state[0]) + 5 if not self.game_over else -50`

This reward function would provide a negative incentive for the lander to stay near the center of the viewport (punishing it for straying) and a strong penalty (-50) when the episode terminates. The `compute_fitness_score` method seems to be related to this individual reward, as it updates an internal dictionary with a fitness score.

This is my interpretation of your reward function.
