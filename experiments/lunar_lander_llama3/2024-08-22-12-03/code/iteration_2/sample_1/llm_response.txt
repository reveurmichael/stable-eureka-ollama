A reinforcement learning problem!

After analyzing the provided code, I've identified the reward function as follows:
```python
def compute_reward(self, state, m_power, s_power, terminated):
    # TO DO: implement your custom reward function here
    pass
```
The `compute_reward` method takes in four inputs:

1. `state`: The current state of the environment (a 8-element array).
2. `m_main_engine_power`: The main engine power.
3. `s_side_engine_power`: The side engine power.
4. `terminated`: A boolean indicating whether the episode has terminated.

The reward function should take into account various aspects, such as:

* Landing safely and close to the target (helipad).
* Maintaining a stable orientation and velocity.
* Efficient use of main and side engines (to minimize fuel consumption).
* Avoiding crashes or falling too far away from the helipad.

You can design your reward function based on these considerations. For example, you might penalize episodes that result in crashes or low speeds, while rewarding those that reach the helipad successfully with a high speed.

Remember to keep your reward function simple and interpretable, as it will influence the behavior of your agent during training. Good luck!
