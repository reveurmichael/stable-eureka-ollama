A reinforcement learning problem!

From the given code, I can see that the reward function is `compute_reward` and it takes in the current state, main engine power (`m_power`), side engine power (`s_power`), and a boolean indicating whether the episode is terminated or not.

Here's my interpretation of the reward reflection:

**Main Goal**: Land safely on the helipad (i.e., not crash-land).

**Reward Structure**:

1. **Landing Bonus**: If the lander lands safely, receive a positive reward.
2. **Crash Penalty**: If the lander crashes or goes off-screen, receive a negative reward.
3. **Engine Power Incentive**: Use `m_power` and `s_power` to encourage efficient engine usage.

**Individual Reward Update**: The fitness score is updated as part of the individual reward. This could be an additional metric that measures how well the agent performed during this episode.

Based on this analysis, I would write the `compute_reward` function as follows:
```python
def compute_reward(state, m_power, s_power, terminated):
    reward = 0

    if not terminated:  # Episode is still ongoing
        # Encourage main engine power for efficient landing
        reward += m_power * 0.5

        # Penalty for crash or going off-screen
        if abs(state[0]) >= 1.0:
            reward -= 10

        # Incentive for side engines (orientation/steering)
        reward += s_power * 0.2

    else:  # Episode is terminated
        # Landing bonus if we made it to the helipad safely
        if state[0] < 1.0:
            reward += 10

    return reward, {}
```
This reward function provides a balance between encouraging efficient engine usage, penalizing crashes or going off-screen, and rewarding successful landings. The individual reward update is simply an empty dictionary in this case, as the fitness score is already being tracked separately.
