A reinforcement learning problem!

Here's my understanding of your reward function:

The goal is to navigate a lander (lander) to touch down safely on a helipad, while minimizing the use of main engines and side engines. The state space includes the lander's position, velocity, angle, and angular velocity, as well as whether its legs are in contact with the ground.

The reward function has two components: `reward` and `individual_reward`.

1. **Reward**: This component seems to encourage or discourage certain behaviors based on the current state.
	* If the lander is close to the helipad (i.e., `state[0] >= 1.0`) or has reached a terminal state (`game_over` or not awake), the reward is likely high, as this indicates success in reaching the goal.
	* Otherwise, the reward might be low, depending on other factors like the lander's velocity and orientation (e.g., `state[3]`, `state[4]`) or whether its legs are grounded (`state[6]`).
2. **Individual Reward**: This component seems to capture more specific aspects of the agent's behavior.
	* `fitness_score`: This could be a measure of how well the lander is performing in terms of its overall fitness, perhaps based on factors like speed, orientation, or ground contact.

To better reflect your reward code:

```
def compute_reward(state, m_power, s_power, terminated):
    # ... (some calculations involving state and engine powers)
    if terminated:
        return 10.0, {}  # High reward for success
    elif abs(state[0]) >= 1.0:  # Lander close to helipad?
        return -5.0, {'fitness_score': 50.0}  # Lower penalty, but higher fitness score
    else:
        # Calculate a more nuanced reward based on state and engine powers...
        # ...and return it along with individual rewards.
        return -1.0, {'fitness_score': 20.0}
```

Please note that this is just an interpretation of your code, and the actual implementation may differ depending on specific requirements and constraints.
