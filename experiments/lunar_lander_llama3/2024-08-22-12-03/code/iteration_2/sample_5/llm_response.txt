    # Calculate the reward based on the position and velocity of the lander
    pos_x = (state[0] + 1) / 2  # Map the x-position to a value between 0 and 1
    pos_y = (state[1] + 1) / 2  # Map the y-position to a value between 0 and 1

    reward = -10.0 * (pos_x ** 2 + pos_y ** 2)  # Quadratic penalty for being far from the target

```
This reward function is designed to encourage the lander to move towards the center of the screen (x=0 and y=self.helipad_y+LEG_DOWN), while also penalizing vertical and horizontal movement. The reward is calculated as a weighted sum of these factors, with the quadratic penalty term dominating.
