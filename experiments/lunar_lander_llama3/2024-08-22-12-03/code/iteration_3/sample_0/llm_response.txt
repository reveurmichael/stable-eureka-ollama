Here's a simple and effective reward function based on the given environment. The goal is to maximize the distance between the lander and the helipad while keeping it grounded.

```
def compute_reward(state, m_power, s_power, terminated):
    if terminated:
        return -10.0, {'alive': 1.0}  # Punish terminated episodes
    else:
        reward = 0.0

        pos_x = state[0]
        vel_x = state[2]

        if abs(pos_x) < 0.5:  # Lander near the helipad
            if vel_x > 1e-3:  # Lander is still moving away from helipad
                reward += 0.01
            else:
                reward -= 1.0  # Punish for not moving away

        if abs(state[1]) < 0.2:  # Lander near the ground
            if state[5] > -10e-3:  # Lander is still rotating downwards
                reward += 0.02
            else:
                reward -= 1.0  # Punish for not rotating downwards

        return reward, {'distance': abs(state[0]), 'velocity': vel_x}
```

This reward function encourages the agent to move away from the helipad while keeping it grounded and rotating downwards. The `compute_fitness_score` function is not necessary as we are already calculating a fitness score in the individual_reward dictionary.

Note that these values are arbitrary and can be adjusted based on the performance of your agent during training.
