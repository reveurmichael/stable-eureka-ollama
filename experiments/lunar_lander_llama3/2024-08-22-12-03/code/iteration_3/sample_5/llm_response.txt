Based on the provided code, I would assume that the reward function is supposed to reflect the agent's performance in the environment. The goal is likely to encourage the agent to successfully land the spacecraft and minimize the time spent in the air.

Here's a possible reward reflection:

The reward is calculated based on the state of the environment and the actions taken by the agent. 

1. **Landing**: If the agent has successfully landed, a positive reward could be given.
2. **Time spent in air**: The longer the agent spends in the air, the more negative the reward should be.
3. **Velocity and position**: A penalty could be applied if the agent's velocity or position is too high.

Here's a sample implementation:

```
def compute_reward(state, m_power, s_power, terminated):
    reward = 0
    if not terminated:
        # Encourage landing by giving positive rewards as the agent gets closer to the ground.
        distance_to_ground = abs(state[1] - (self.helipad_y + LEG_DOWN / SCALE))
        reward += 10 * (1 - distance_to_ground)
        
        # Penalize time spent in air
        reward -= 0.05
        
        # Encourage low velocity and position
        if state[2] > 5 or state[3] > 5:
            reward -= 0.1
            
    else:
        # Give a large positive reward for successful landing
        if state[0] < 0.1:  # Adjust the threshold as needed
            reward += 100
    
    return reward, {'time_spent': -reward}
```

This is just one possible way to design a reward function. The key idea is to create a balance between exploration and exploitation by providing rewards that encourage good behavior while avoiding bad behavior.
