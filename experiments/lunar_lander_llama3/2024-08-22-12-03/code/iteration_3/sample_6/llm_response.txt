A reinforcement learning problem!

To help me better understand your scenario and provide a suitable reward function, I'll need to analyze the provided code. It seems like you're working on a physics-based environment where an agent (the lander) needs to navigate to a target location while avoiding certain conditions.

From what I can see, the reward function is computed based on the current state of the lander, its power levels (`m_power` and `s_power`), and whether the episode has terminated. The goal seems to be maximizing the fitness score while minimizing the penalty for not reaching the target location or exceeding certain power thresholds.

Here's a possible reward reflection:

```
def compute_reward(state, m_power, s_power, terminated):
    # Reward structure:
    #   1. Encourage landing near the target location (high reward)
    #   2. Penalize excessive power usage (m_power > 0.5 and s_power > 0.5)
    #   3. Provide a moderate reward for stable flight (angular velocity < 10)

    if terminated:
        # Episode ended, penalize for not reaching the target
        return -1.0, {'terminated': True}
    
    # Calculate distance from target location
    target_distance = np.linalg.norm((state[0], state[1]) - (0, self.helipad_y + LEG_DOWN / SCALE))
    if target_distance < 0.5:  # close enough to the target
        reward = 1.0
    else:
        reward = 0.5

    # Adjust reward based on power levels and stability
    if m_power > 0.5 or s_power > 0.5:
        reward -= 0.2  # excessive power usage penalty
    if abs(state[4]) < 10:  # stable flight, moderate reward
        reward += 0.1

    return reward, {'reward': reward}
```

This is just a starting point, and you may need to adjust the weights and thresholds based on your specific environment and learning objectives. The `compute_fitness_score` function seems to be related to this reward calculation, so you might want to consider incorporating similar logic there as well.

How's that? Does it seem like a suitable starting point for your reinforcement learning problem?
