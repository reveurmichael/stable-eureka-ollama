Here's a potential reward function that could work for this reinforcement learning task:

```
def compute_reward(self, state, m_power, s_power, terminated):
    # Define the reward structure
    reward = 0.0
    individual_reward = {}

    # If the game is over or the lander has fallen off the screen, consider it a failure and penalize the agent
    if terminated:
        reward -= 10.0
        individual_reward['loss'] = -10.0
    else:
        # Reward the agent for staying close to the center of the screen
        distance_to_center = np.sqrt((state[0] + 1)**2 + (state[1] + 1)**2)
        reward += 0.5 * (1 - distance_to_center)

        # If the lander is near the edge of the screen, penalize it slightly to encourage it to stay in the center
        if state[0] > 0.75 or state[0] < -0.75 or state[1] > 0.75 or state[1] < -0.75:
            reward -= 0.2

        # Reward the agent for having a low vertical velocity (i.e., it's close to the ground)
        if state[3] < 0.5:
            reward += 0.1
        else:
            reward -= 0.1

    return reward, individual_reward
```

This reward function encourages the agent to:

* Stay close to the center of the screen (rewarded with a higher score)
* Avoid going near the edge of the screen (penalized slightly if it does)
* Keep its vertical velocity low (rewarded if it's close to the ground, penalized otherwise)

Note that this is just one possible reward function, and you may need to adjust or modify it depending on your specific requirements.
