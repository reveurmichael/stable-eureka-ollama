Based on the provided code, I would suggest a reward function that incentivizes the agent to achieve its goals. Here's a possible approach:

1. **Landing successfully**: Reward the agent with a high value when it lands safely on the helipad.
2. **Velocity and position control**: Encourage the agent to maintain a reasonable velocity (e.g., within a certain range) and position (e.g., close to the desired location).
3. **Angle control**: Reward the agent for keeping its angle close to the desired value.
4. **Avoidance of obstacles**: Provide a penalty when the agent collides with obstacles or strays too far from the landing site.

Here's an example reward function that incorporates these elements:
```python
def compute_reward(state, m_power, s_power, terminated):
    reward = 0.0

    # Landing successfully
    if state[0] < 1.0 and state[1] < 1.0:  # position and velocity within bounds
        reward += 10.0

    # Velocity and position control
    vel_diff = abs(state[2]) - 5.0  # adjust this value based on desired velocity range
    pos_diff = abs(state[1]) - 0.5  # adjust this value based on desired position range
    reward += -vel_diff - pos_diff

    # Angle control
    angle_diff = abs(state[4] - self.desired_angle)  # adjust this value based on desired angle range
    reward += -angle_diff

    # Avoidance of obstacles (penalty for collision or straying too far)
    if terminated:
        reward -= 10.0  # significant penalty for game over

    return reward, {}
```
This reward function is just a starting point and may need to be adjusted based on the specific characteristics of your environment and desired agent behavior.

Please note that this code assumes you have defined `self.desired_angle` and `FPS` in your `LandSimulator` class.
