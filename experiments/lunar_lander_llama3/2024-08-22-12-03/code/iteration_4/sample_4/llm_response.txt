Based on the provided code, the reward function appears to be a combination of the current state and the actions taken. The reward is computed using the `compute_reward` method.

Here's a possible reflection of the reward:

The reward function seems to incentivize the agent to reach the target location (helipad) while maintaining a certain level of stability and control. The presence of terms such as `m_power` and `s_power` suggests that the reward is affected by the magnitude and direction of the main engine thrust and side engines, respectively.

The fact that the reward is updated based on the state (`state`) and whether the episode has terminated (`terminated`) implies that the agent's progress towards the goal is being rewarded. The presence of terms such as `angle` and `angularVelocity` in the state suggests that maintaining a stable orientation is also an important aspect of the task.

Overall, it appears that the reward function is designed to balance exploration-exploitation trade-offs, encouraging the agent to explore different actions while still making progress towards achieving the goal.
