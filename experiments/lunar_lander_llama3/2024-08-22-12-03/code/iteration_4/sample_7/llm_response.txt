A reinforcement learning problem!

The goal is to create an effective reward function that guides the agent's behavior in a physics-based environment. Here's my reflection on the current reward code:

**Observations**

1. The reward function is quite complex, involving multiple variables like `m_power`, `s_power`, and `state`.
2. The reward seems to be designed to encourage the agent to move forward while avoiding penalties for not achieving its goals.
3. There are two separate reward calculations: one for `reward` and another for `individual_reward`. The latter appears to include additional information like `fitness_score`.

**Insights**

1. The current reward function might not be well-suited for the task at hand, as it seems to prioritize movement over other important aspects of the game (e.g., landing safely).
2. The use of absolute values in the reward calculation (`abs(state[0])`) may not be optimal, as it can create discontinuities in the reward landscape.
3. The `fitness_score` computation seems unrelated to the main reward function, which might indicate that there are multiple objectives being optimized simultaneously.

**Suggestions**

1. Simplify the reward function by focusing on a few key aspects of the game (e.g., forward movement, safety, and orientation).
2. Consider using relative values instead of absolute values in the reward calculation.
3. Explore different reward shaping techniques to better align the agent's behavior with the desired goals.

The next training session will indeed reuse some of the relevant information from previous trainings. Let me know if you'd like to discuss any specific aspects of the reward function or the environment!
