Here's a variation of the initial reward proposal:

```
def compute_reward(self, state, action, next_state, terminated):
    # Unpack state variables
    x, y, vx, vy, angle, angular_velocity, left_leg, right_leg = state

    # Distance-based reward: incentivize moving towards the landing pad
    distance_reward = -np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    distance_reward = np.exp(distance_reward / 100.0) - 1

    # Stability reward: penalize tilting and angular velocity, but reduce penalty as it gets closer to the landing pad
    angle_penalty = -np.abs(angle)
    angle_penalty = np.tanh((angle_penalty + np.abs(x)) / 0.5)

    angular_velocity_penalty = -np.abs(angular_velocity)
    angular_velocity_penalty = np.tanh((angular_velocity_penalty + np.abs(y)) / 0.5)

    # Velocity reward: penalize high velocities, but reduce penalty as it gets closer to the landing pad
    velocity_penalty = -(np.abs(vx) + np.abs(vy))
    velocity_penalty = np.tanh((velocity_penalty + np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)) / 1.0)

    # Fuel efficiency reward: penalize using the main engine, but reduce penalty as it gets closer to the landing pad
    fuel_penalty = -0.5 if action == 2 else 0

    # Landing reward: bonus for successful landing
    landing_reward = 0
    if left_leg and right_leg:
        landing_reward = 100 if abs(x) < 0.1 and abs(y) < 0.1 else 10

    # Total reward: a weighted sum of all components, with the distance-based reward dominating
    reward = (distance_reward * 5
              + 0.2 * angle_penalty
              + 0.2 * angular_velocity_penalty
              + 0.3 * velocity_penalty
              + 0.05 * fuel_penalty
              + landing_reward)

    # Apply a penalty if the episode is terminated (crash or out of bounds)
    if terminated and not (left_leg and right_leg):
        reward -= 100

    individual_reward = {
        "distance_reward": distance_reward,
        "angle_penalty": angle_penalty,
        "angular_velocity_penalty": angular_velocity_penalty,
        "velocity_penalty": velocity_penalty,
        "fuel_penalty": fuel_penalty,
        "landing_reward": landing_reward,
    }

    return reward, individual_reward
```

This variation adds a few more features to the initial reward proposal:

1. The distance-based reward now dominates the total reward.
2. The stability and velocity rewards are reduced as it gets closer to the landing pad.
3. The fuel efficiency reward is also reduced as it gets closer to the landing pad.

These changes should encourage the agent to prioritize moving towards the landing pad while maintaining a stable attitude and controlling its velocity.
