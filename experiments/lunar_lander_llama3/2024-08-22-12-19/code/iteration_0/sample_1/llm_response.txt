Here's an alternative reward proposal:

```
def compute_reward(self, state, action, next_state, terminated):
    # Unpack state variables
    x, y, vx, vy, angle, angular_velocity, left_leg, right_leg = state

    # Distance-based reward: incentivize moving towards the landing pad
    distance_reward = 1 - np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2) / (VIEWPORT_W / SCALE / 2)

    # Stability reward: incentivize stable tilting and low angular velocity
    angle_bonus = np.tanh(angle) * 0.5
    angular_velocity_bonus = np.exp(-angular_velocity**2 / 20.0) * 1.0

    # Velocity reward: penalize high velocities and encourage stable descent
    velocity_penalty = -(np.abs(vx) + np.abs(vy)) * 0.01
    velocity_bonus = np.tanh(np.sqrt(vx**2 + vy**2)) * 0.5

    # Fuel efficiency reward: incentivize using the side engines
    fuel_bonus = action == 1 or action == 3 and 0.5 else -0.5

    # Landing reward: bonus for successful landing
    landing_reward = 100 if left_leg and right_leg and abs(x) < 0.1 and abs(y) < 0.1 else 10

    # Total reward: a weighted sum of all components
    reward = (distance_reward
              + angle_bonus
              + angular_velocity_bonus
              + velocity_penalty
              + fuel_bonus
              + landing_reward)

    # Apply a penalty if the episode is terminated (crash or out of bounds)
    if terminated and not (left_leg and right_leg):
        reward -= 100

    individual_reward = {
        "distance_reward": distance_reward,
        "angle_bonus": angle_bonus,
        "angular_velocity_bonus": angular_velocity_bonus,
        "velocity_penalty": velocity_penalty,
        "fuel_bonus": fuel_bonus,
        "landing_reward": landing_reward
    }

    return reward, individual_reward
```

In this variation, the `distance_reward` is incentivized by making it a function of the distance from the landing pad. The `angle_bonus` and `angular_velocity_bonus` are designed to encourage stable tilting and low angular velocity, respectively. The `velocity_penalty` penalizes high velocities and encourages stable descent. The `fuel_bonus` rewards the use of side engines and penalizes the use of the main engine. The `landing_reward` is a bonus for successful landing.

This reward function aims to create an environment that incentivizes the agent to land safely while minimizing fuel consumption and velocity.
