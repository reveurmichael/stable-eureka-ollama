Here's a variation of the initial reward proposal:

```
def compute_reward(self, state, m_power, s_power, terminated):
    # Unpack state variables
    x, y, vx, vy, angle, angular_velocity, left_leg, right_leg = state

    # Distance-based reward: incentivize moving towards the landing pad
    distance_reward = -np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    distance_reward = np.exp(distance_reward / 100.0) - 1

    # Stability reward: penalize tilting and angular velocity
    angle_penalty = -np.abs(angle)
    angle_penalty = np.tanh(angle_penalty / 0.5)

    angular_velocity_penalty = -np.abs(angular_velocity)
    angular_velocity_penalty = np.tanh(angular_velocity_penalty / 0.5)

    # Velocity reward: penalize high velocities
    velocity_penalty = -(np.abs(vx) + np.abs(vy))
    velocity_penalty = np.tanh(velocity_penalty / 1.0)

    # Fuel efficiency reward: incentivize using the side engines and main engine efficiently
    fuel_reward = -m_power if m_power > 0 else s_power

    # Landing reward: bonus for successful landing
    landing_reward = 0
    if left_leg and right_leg:
        landing_reward = 100 if abs(x) < 0.1 and abs(y) < 0.1 else 10

    # Total reward: a weighted sum of all components
    reward = (distance_reward
              + 0.2 * angle_penalty
              + 0.1 * angular_velocity_penalty
              + 0.3 * velocity_penalty
              + 0.05 * fuel_reward
              + landing_reward)

    # Apply a penalty if the episode is terminated (crash or out of bounds)
    if terminated and not (left_leg and right_leg):
        reward -= 100

    individual_reward = {
        "distance_reward": distance_reward,
        "angle_penalty": angle_penalty,
        "angular_velocity_penalty": angular_velocity_penalty,
        "velocity_penalty": velocity_penalty,
        "fuel_reward": fuel_reward,
        "landing_reward": landing_reward,
    }

    return reward, individual_reward
```

This variation provides a different balance between the components of the reward function. The fuel efficiency reward is now incentivizing the use of both side engines and main engine efficiently by giving a positive reward for using them correctly and penalizing the use of the main engine.
