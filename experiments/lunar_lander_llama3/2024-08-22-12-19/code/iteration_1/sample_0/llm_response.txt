Based on the feedback provided, I'll analyze each existing reward component and propose an improved reward function.

**Analyzing Existing Reward Components**

1. **Distance-based reward**: The values are highly negative (range -39 to -105). This suggests that the agent is not moving towards the landing pad effectively. Consider increasing the temperature parameter or re-writing this component.
2. **Height reward**: The values are relatively small (range -0.01 to 0), indicating a moderate impact on the overall reward. This component seems reasonable, but it could be further tweaked for better performance.
3. **Velocity penalty**: The values are highly negative (range -101 to -150). This suggests that high velocities are indeed a problem, and this component is doing its job well.
4. **Fuel penalty**: The values are either 0 or -1, indicating a simple binary penalty. This component seems straightforward, but it might be worth considering more nuanced fuel efficiency metrics.
5. **Landing reward**: The values are either 10 or 100, depending on whether the agent has successfully landed. This component provides a clear incentive for successful landings.

**Proposed Improved Reward Function**

Based on the analysis above, I suggest the following improved reward function:

```python
def compute_reward(self, state, action, next_state, terminated):
    # Unpack state variables
    x, y, vx, vy, angle, angular_velocity, left_leg, right_leg = state

    # Distance-based reward: incentivize moving towards the landing pad (temperature increased)
    distance_reward = -np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2) / 50.0  # increase temperature by dividing by 50

    # Height reward: keep the lander at a reasonable height
    height_penalty = -(y - self.helipad_y) ** 2
    height_penalty = np.tanh(height_penalty / 1.5)  # adjust temperature for better performance

    # Velocity penalty: discourage high velocities (increased magnitude)
    velocity_penalty = -(np.abs(vx) + np.abs(vy)) ** 3  # increase magnitude by cubing the velocity
    velocity_penalty = np.tanh(velocity_penalty / 1.0)

    # Fuel efficiency reward: penalize using the main engine
    fuel_penalty = -1 if action == 2 else 0  # keep this component simple

    # Landing reward: bonus for successful landing (increased magnitude)
    landing_reward = 500 if left_leg and right_leg else 50  # increase magnitude by a factor of 5

    # Total reward: a weighted sum of all components
    reward = (distance_reward + 0.2 * height_penalty + 0.3 * velocity_penalty - 0.01 * fuel_penalty + landing_reward)

    # Apply a penalty if the episode is terminated (crash or out of bounds)
    if terminated and not (left_leg and right_leg):
        reward -= 100

    individual_reward = {
        "distance_reward": distance_reward,
        "height_penalty": height_penalty,
        "velocity_penalty": velocity_penalty,
        "fuel_penalty": fuel_penalty,
        "landing_reward": landing_reward,
    }

    return reward, individual_reward
```

**Changes**

* Increased the temperature parameter for the distance-based reward to incentivize movement towards the landing pad.
* Adjusted the temperature parameter for the height penalty component to better balance the trade-off between height and velocity.
* Increased the magnitude of the velocity penalty by cubing the velocity to discourage high velocities more effectively.
* Increased the magnitude of the landing reward to provide a stronger incentive for successful landings.

These changes aim to address the issues identified in the feedback, such as the agent not moving towards the landing pad effectively and not achieving successful landings consistently.
