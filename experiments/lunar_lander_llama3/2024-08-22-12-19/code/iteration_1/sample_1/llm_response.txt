Based on the feedback, I'll analyze each existing reward component and propose an improved reward function.

1. **Distance-based reward**: The values are highly negative (up to -150). This could be due to the large magnitude of the distance reward. Let's try scaling it down or removing it altogether.
2. **Height reward**: The penalty is not very pronounced, as the values are close to zero. We can keep this component, but consider increasing its magnitude or adjusting its temperature parameter.
3. **Velocity penalty**: Similar to the height reward, the penalty is not strong enough. We can increase the magnitude of the velocity penalty to discourage high velocities more effectively.
4. **Fuel efficiency reward**: The fuel penalty is binary (0 or -1), which might not be effective in encouraging fuel efficiency. Let's consider a more nuanced approach, such as penalizing the agent for using the main engine at certain times.
5. **Landing reward**: This component seems to be working well, but we can further refine it by adjusting the thresholds for successful landing.

Considering these insights, I'll propose an updated reward function:
```python
def compute_reward(self, state, action, next_state, terminated):
    # Unpack state variables
    x, y, vx, vy, angle, angular_velocity, left_leg, right_leg = state

    # Height reward: keep the lander at a reasonable height
    height_penalty = -(y - self.helipad_y) ** 2
    height_penalty = np.tanh(height_penalty / 5.0)

    # Velocity penalty: discourage high velocities
    velocity_penalty = -(np.abs(vx) + np.abs(vy)) ** 3
    velocity_penalty = np.tanh(velocity_penalty / 1.5)

    # Fuel efficiency reward: penalize using the main engine at certain times
    fuel_penalty = -0.2 if action == 2 and abs(vx) > 5 else 0

    # Landing reward: bonus for successful landing
    landing_reward = 0
    if left_leg and right_leg:
        landing_reward = 50 if abs(x) < 0.1 and abs(y) < 0.1 else 10

    # Total reward: a weighted sum of all components
    reward = (height_penalty + 0.7 * velocity_penalty - fuel_penalty + landing_reward)

    # Apply a penalty if the episode is terminated (crash or out of bounds)
    if terminated and not (left_leg and right_leg):
        reward -= 50

    individual_reward = {
        "height_penalty": height_penalty,
        "velocity_penalty": velocity_penalty,
        "fuel_penalty": fuel_penalty,
        "landing_reward": landing_reward,
    }

    return reward, individual_reward
```
This updated reward function aims to:

1. Increase the emphasis on maintaining a reasonable height.
2. Strengthen the velocity penalty to discourage high velocities.
3. Refine the fuel efficiency reward by penalizing the agent for using the main engine at certain times.
4. Maintain the landing reward as it is working well.

The next training will take the best model weights, which should reuse some of the relevant information from the previous training and improve the policy further.
