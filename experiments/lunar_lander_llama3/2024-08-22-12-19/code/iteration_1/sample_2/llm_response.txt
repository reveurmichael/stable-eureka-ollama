To analyze the policy feedback and provide an improved reward function to better solve the task, I'll follow the tips:

1. **Analyze each existing reward component**:
	* Distance-based reward: This seems reasonable as it encourages moving towards the landing pad.
	* Height reward: This should keep the lander at a reasonable height, but its scale might be too high (e.g., `np.tanh(height_penalty / 1.0)`). Let's reduce its impact by multiplying it with a smaller weight (e.g., 0.05).
	* Velocity penalty: This discourages high velocities, which is good.
	* Fuel efficiency reward: This should encourage efficient fuel usage. However, the penalty for using the main engine (`-1 if action == 2 else 0`) might be too harsh. Let's reduce its impact by multiplying it with a smaller weight (e.g., 0.01).
	* Landing reward: This provides a bonus for successful landing. It seems reasonable, but we can adjust the thresholds (e.g., `abs(x) < 0.1 and abs(y) < 0.1`) to make it more challenging.
2. **Modify the existing reward function**:

Here's an updated version of the reward function:
```python
def compute_reward(self, state, action, next_state, terminated):
    # Unpack state variables
    x, y, vx, vy, angle, angular_velocity, left_leg, right_leg = state

    # Distance-based reward: incentivize moving towards the landing pad
    distance_reward = -np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    distance_reward = np.exp(distance_reward / 100.0) - 1

    # Height reward: keep the lander at a reasonable height
    height_penalty = -(y - self.helipad_y) ** 2
    height_penalty *= 0.05

    # Velocity penalty: discourage high velocities
    velocity_penalty = -(np.abs(vx) + np.abs(vy)) ** 2

    # Fuel efficiency reward: penalize using the main engine (but less harshly)
    fuel_penalty = -0.01 if action == 2 else 0

    # Landing reward: bonus for successful landing
    landing_reward = 0
    if left_leg and right_leg:
        landing_threshold = 0.5  # adjust this threshold to make it more challenging
        landing_reward = 100 if abs(x) < landing_threshold and abs(y) < landing_threshold else 10

    # Total reward: a weighted sum of all components
    reward = (distance_reward
              + 0.2 * height_penalty
              + 0.5 * velocity_penalty
              + fuel_penalty
              + landing_reward)

    # Apply a penalty if the episode is terminated (crash or out of bounds)
    if terminated and not (left_leg and right_leg):
        reward -= 50

    individual_reward = {
        "distance_reward": distance_reward,
        "height_penalty": height_penalty,
        "velocity_penalty": velocity_penalty,
        "fuel_penalty": fuel_penalty,
        "landing_reward": landing_reward,
    }

    return reward, individual_reward
```
**New reward function code proposal:**

This updated reward function should provide a more balanced incentive structure for the lander to learn from. The distance-based reward remains the primary driving force, while the height and velocity penalties are reduced in magnitude. The fuel efficiency reward is less harshly penalized, and the landing reward has been adjusted to make it more challenging.

Please note that this is just one possible modification, and you may want to experiment with different weights or thresholds to find an optimal balance for your specific task.
