Based on the feedback provided, I'll analyze each existing reward component and propose an improved reward function.

1. Distance-based reward:
   The distance-based reward is not well-behaved as its values are spread across a wide range (-28.0 to -39.7). This could be due to the fact that it's calculated using `np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)`, which can result in high values when the lander is far from the landing pad. To address this, I'll use a more stable and well-behaved function, such as `1 / (1 + np.exp(distance))` to reward the agent for moving closer to the landing pad.

2. Height reward:
   The height penalty seems reasonable, but it might be beneficial to add some noise to avoid overfitting. I'll use a combination of the original height penalty and some Gaussian noise to achieve this.

3. Velocity penalty:
   The velocity penalty also seems well-behaved. However, it's essential to note that the values are quite high (-150.18 is the minimum value). This might result in the agent being overly penalized for having high velocities. I'll scale down the velocity penalty to make it more comparable to other reward components.

4. Fuel efficiency reward:
   The fuel penalty seems reasonable, but its magnitude is significantly larger than that of other reward components. I'll rescale it to have a similar range as other rewards.

5. Landing reward:
   The landing reward is binary (0 or 100), which might not be the most effective way to encourage successful landings. I'll use a more gradual approach by awarding the agent with a positive reward that increases as the lander approaches the landing pad and eventually lands successfully.

6. Termination penalty:
   The termination penalty seems reasonable, but its magnitude is quite high (-100). I'll rescale it to have a similar range as other rewards.

Considering these points, here's my proposal for an improved reward function:

```Python
def compute_reward(self, state, action, next_state, terminated):
    # Unpack state variables
    x, y, vx, vy, angle, angular_velocity, left_leg, right_leg = state

    # Distance-based reward: incentivize moving towards the landing pad
    distance_reward = 1 / (1 + np.exp(-np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2) / 100.0))

    # Height penalty: keep the lander at a reasonable height
    height_penalty = -(y - self.helipad_y) ** 2 + 0.5 * np.random.normal(0, 1)
    height_penalty = np.tanh(height_penalty / 1.0)

    # Velocity penalty: discourage high velocities
    velocity_penalty = -(np.abs(vx) + np.abs(vy)) ** 2 / 100

    # Fuel efficiency reward: penalize using the main engine
    fuel_penalty = -1 if action == 2 else 0

    # Landing reward: bonus for successful landing
    landing_reward = min(max(0, (abs(x) < 0.1 and abs(y) < 0.1)), 100)

    # Termination penalty: penalize when the episode is terminated
    termination_penalty = -5 if terminated and not (left_leg and right_leg) else 0

    # Total reward: a weighted sum of all components
    reward = (distance_reward + 
              0.2 * height_penalty + 
              0.4 * velocity_penalty + 
              0.01 * fuel_penalty + 
              landing_reward + 
              termination_penalty)

    individual_reward = {
        "distance_reward": distance_reward,
        "height_penalty": height_penalty,
        "velocity_penalty": velocity_penalty,
        "fuel_penalty": fuel_penalty,
        "landing_reward": landing_reward,
        "termination_penalty": termination_penalty
    }

    return reward, individual_reward
```

This revised reward function aims to address the issues mentioned earlier and provide a more balanced and stable reward signal for the agent.
