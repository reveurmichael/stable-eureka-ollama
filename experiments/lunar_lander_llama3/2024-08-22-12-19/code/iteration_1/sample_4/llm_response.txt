Based on the provided feedback and analysis guidelines, I'll analyze each existing reward component and propose a new reward function.

**Analysis:**

1. **Distance-based reward**: The values are not identical, but the magnitude is relatively small compared to others. This component seems to be doing its job.
2. **Height penalty**: The values are mostly negative, which suggests that the agent should maintain a reasonable height. However, the scale is quite high, and this component might be over-penalizing the agent. Suggested change: reduce the scale or temperature parameter of this component.
3. **Velocity penalty**: The values are generally negative, indicating that high velocities should be discouraged. This component seems to be doing its job well.
4. **Fuel penalty**: The values are mostly 0 (no main engine used) or -1 (main engine used). This component is binary and might not provide sufficient gradients for the agent to learn from. Suggested change: re-write this component to provide more nuanced feedback, such as a penalty that decreases with each main engine use.
5. **Landing reward**: The values are mostly 0 (not landed) or 100 (successfully landed). This component seems to be doing its job well.
6. **Termination penalty**: The values are -100 when the episode is terminated and the agent has not successfully landed. This component seems necessary to discourage crashes.

**New Reward Function Proposal:**

```
def compute_reward(self, state, action, next_state, terminated):
    # Unpack state variables
    x, y, vx, vy, angle, angular_velocity, left_leg, right_leg = state

    # Distance-based reward: incentivize moving towards the landing pad
    distance_reward = -np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    distance_reward = np.exp(distance_reward / 50.0) - 1

    # Height reward: keep the lander at a reasonable height (reduced scale)
    height_penalty = -(y - self.helipad_y) ** 2
    height_penalty = np.tanh(height_penalty / 0.5)

    # Velocity penalty: discourage high velocities (slightly increased magnitude)
    velocity_penalty = -(np.abs(vx) + np.abs(vy)) ** 2
    velocity_penalty = np.tanh(velocity_penalty / 1.5)

    # Fuel efficiency reward: penalize using the main engine (re-written component)
    fuel_penalty = max(-0.01, -0.005 * action)

    # Landing reward: bonus for successful landing
    landing_reward = 0
    if left_leg and right_leg:
        landing_reward = 100 if abs(x) < 0.1 and abs(y) < 0.1 else 10

    # Total reward: a weighted sum of all components
    reward = (distance_reward
              + 0.1 * height_penalty
              + 0.6 * velocity_penalty
              + fuel_penalty
              + landing_reward)

    # Apply a penalty if the episode is terminated (crash or out of bounds)
    if terminated and not (left_leg and right_leg):
        reward -= 50

    individual_reward = {
        "distance_reward": distance_reward,
        "height_penalty": height_penalty,
        "velocity_penalty": velocity_penalty,
        "fuel_penalty": fuel_penalty,
        "landing_reward": landing_reward,
    }

    return reward, individual_reward
```

The changes I made include:

* Reduced the scale of the height penalty component to discourage over-penalization.
* Slightly increased the magnitude of the velocity penalty component to provide stronger gradients.
* Re-wrote the fuel penalty component to provide more nuanced feedback and a decreasing penalty with each main engine use.
* Adjusted the weights of the components in the total reward calculation.

This new reward function proposal should provide a better balance between exploration and exploitation, encouraging the agent to learn a more effective policy.
