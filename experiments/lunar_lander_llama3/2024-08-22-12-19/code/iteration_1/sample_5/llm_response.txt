Analyzing the feedback:

1. The distance-based reward component's values are not identical, but they do increase when the lander moves away from the landing pad (minimize). This suggests that we should scale this component or re-write it to make it more negative for moving away.
2. The height penalty component has a similar magnitude as the other components. We can leave it as is.
3. The velocity penalty component's magnitude is significantly larger than others. Let's scale it down by a factor of 10.
4. The fuel efficiency reward (penalty) seems to be working well, but we could consider scaling it up or re-writing it for more nuanced feedback.

New Reward Function Proposal:

```
def compute_reward(self, state, action, next_state, terminated):
    # Unpack state variables
    x, y, vx, vy, angle, angular_velocity, left_leg, right_leg = state

    # Distance-based reward: incentivize moving towards the landing pad
    distance_reward = -np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2) / 100.0
    distance_reward = np.exp(distance_reward) - 1

    # Height reward: keep the lander at a reasonable height
    height_penalty = -(y - self.helipad_y) ** 2

    # Velocity penalty: discourage high velocities (scaled down by 10)
    velocity_penalty = -(np.abs(vx) + np.abs(vy)) ** 2 / 10.0
    velocity_penalty = np.tanh(velocity_penalty / 1.0)

    # Fuel efficiency reward: penalize using the main engine
    fuel_penalty = -1 if action == 2 else 0

    # Landing reward: bonus for successful landing
    landing_reward = 0
    if left_leg and right_leg:
        landing_reward = 100 if abs(x) < 0.1 and abs(y) < 0.1 else 10

    # Total reward: a weighted sum of all components
    reward = (distance_reward
              + 0.2 * height_penalty
              + 0.5 * velocity_penalty
              + 0.01 * fuel_penalty
              + landing_reward)

    # Apply a penalty if the episode is terminated (crash or out of bounds)
    if terminated and not (left_leg and right_leg):
        reward -= 100

    individual_reward = {
        "distance_reward": distance_reward,
        "height_penalty": height_penalty,
        "velocity_penalty": velocity_penalty,
        "fuel_penalty": fuel_penalty,
        "landing_reward": landing_reward,
    }

    return reward, individual_reward
```

This new reward function should provide more nuanced feedback to the agent. The distance-based reward is now more strongly discouraged for moving away from the landing pad, and the velocity penalty has been scaled down to reduce its influence on the agent's behavior.
