Based on the provided feedback, I'll analyze each existing reward component and propose an improved reward function.

**Analysis**

1. **Distance-based reward**: The values are mostly negative, indicating that the agent is moving away from the landing pad. This suggests that the scale or temperature parameter might need adjustment.
2. **Height reward**: The values are mostly negative, suggesting that the agent is not staying at a reasonable height. This component seems to be doing its job correctly.
3. **Velocity penalty**: The values are mostly negative, indicating that high velocities are discouraged. However, the magnitude of this component is significantly larger than others, so it might need rescaling.
4. **Fuel efficiency reward**: The values are mostly negative, suggesting that using the main engine is penalized. This component seems to be doing its job correctly.
5. **Landing reward**: The values are mostly positive when the agent successfully lands, which is a good thing! However, this component's magnitude is relatively small compared to others, so it might need some adjustment.

**Proposed Improved Reward Function**

To better solve the task, I'll make the following changes:

* Adjust the scale of the distance-based reward component.
* Rescale the velocity penalty component to be more comparable in magnitude to other components.
* Increase the magnitude of the landing reward component to encourage successful landings.

Here's the proposed improved reward function:
```python
def compute_reward(self, state, action, next_state, terminated):
    # ... (rest of the code remains the same)

    # Distance-based reward: incentivize moving towards the landing pad
    distance_reward = -np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2) / 10.0  # adjust scale

    # Total reward: a weighted sum of all components
    reward = (distance_reward
              + 0.3 * height_penalty  # keep this component's weight the same
              + 0.1 * velocity_penalty  # rescale velocity penalty
              + 0.01 * fuel_penalty
              + 50 * landing_reward)  # increase magnitude of landing reward

    if terminated and not (left_leg and right_leg):
        reward -= 100  # apply termination penalty

    individual_reward = {
        "distance_reward": distance_reward,
        "height_penalty": height_penalty,
        "velocity_penalty": velocity_penalty,
        "fuel_penalty": fuel_penalty,
        "landing_reward": landing_reward,
    }

    return reward, individual_reward
```
This improved reward function should encourage the agent to move towards the landing pad while maintaining a reasonable height and velocity. Successful landings will also be rewarded more strongly.
