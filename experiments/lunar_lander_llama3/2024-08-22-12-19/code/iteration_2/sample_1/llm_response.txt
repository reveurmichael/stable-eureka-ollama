Analyzing the feedback:

1. The `fitness_score` component is not relevant to the current reward function, but it's essential to note that it's supposed to be maximized.
2. The `reward` component has a mix of positive and negative values. This suggests that the reward function should focus on promoting desirable behaviors (e.g., moving towards the landing pad) while minimizing undesired ones (e.g., crashing or using too much fuel).
3. The `episode_length` component seems to indicate that longer episodes are not necessarily better. This might suggest modifying the reward function to discourage long episodes or focusing on maximizing the rewards within each episode.

To address these issues, I propose a revised reward function:

```
def compute_reward(self, state, action, next_state, terminated):
    # Unpack state variables
    x, y, vx, vy, angle, angular_velocity, left_leg, right_leg = state
    
    # Distance-based reward: incentivize moving towards the landing pad
    distance_reward = -np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    
    # Height reward: keep the lander at a reasonable height
    height_penalty = -(y - self.helipad_y) ** 2
    height_penalty = np.tanh(height_penalty / 1.0)
    
    # Velocity penalty: discourage high velocities
    velocity_penalty = -(np.abs(vx) + np.abs(vy)) ** 2
    velocity_penalty = np.tanh(velocity_penalty / 1.0)
    
    # Fuel efficiency reward: penalize using the main engine
    fuel_penalty = -1 if action == 2 else 0
    
    # Landing reward: bonus for successful landing
    landing_reward = 100 if left_leg and right_leg and abs(x) < 0.1 and abs(y) < 0.1 else 10
    
    # Episode length penalty: discourage long episodes
    episode_length_penalty = -(episode_length / 80.0) ** 2
    episode_length_penalty = np.tanh(episode_length_penalty / 1.0)
    
    # Total reward: a weighted sum of all components
    reward = (distance_reward + 
              0.3 * height_penalty + 
              0.4 * velocity_penalty + 
              0.01 * fuel_penalty + 
              landing_reward + 
              episode_length_penalty)
    
    individual_reward = {
        "distance_reward": distance_reward,
        "height_penalty": height_penalty,
        "velocity_penalty": velocity_penalty,
        "fuel_penalty": fuel_penalty,
        "landing_reward": landing_reward,
        "episode_length_penalty": episode_length_penalty,
    }
    
    return reward, individual_reward
```

Changes:

* Removed the `fitness_score` component since it's not relevant to the current reward function.
* Re-weighted the components to emphasize moving towards the landing pad and maintaining a reasonable height.
* Added an episode length penalty to discourage long episodes.
* Modified the `landing_reward` to only provide a bonus when the lander successfully lands on the helipad.

The revised reward function should better promote desirable behaviors while minimizing undesired ones.
