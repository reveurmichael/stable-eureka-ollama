Based on the analysis of the policy feedback and the existing reward function, I propose an improved reward function that addresses the issues and encourages more effective learning.

**Analysis**

1. The distance-based reward component has a large range (-28.0 to -39.7), indicating that it is the dominant factor in determining the overall reward.
2. The height penalty and velocity penalty components have similar values, suggesting that they are not effectively differentiating between good and bad behaviors.
3. The fuel efficiency reward component always penalizes using the main engine (fuel_penalty = -1), which may be too harsh.
4. The landing reward component only provides a bonus when the lander successfully lands (left_leg and right_leg).

**Improved Reward Function Proposal**

I suggest modifying the existing reward function to:

* Re-weight the distance-based reward to balance it with other components
* Introduce a more nuanced height penalty that encourages stable flight heights
* Modify the velocity penalty to discourage high velocities while still allowing for some movement
* Relax the fuel efficiency penalty to encourage more exploration
* Simplify the landing reward component

Here's the proposed improved reward function code:
```python
def compute_reward(self, state, action, next_state, terminated):
    # Unpack state variables
    x, y, vx, vy, angle, angular_velocity, left_leg, right_leg = state
    
    # Distance-based reward: incentivize moving towards the landing pad
    distance_reward = -np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    distance_reward = np.exp(distance_reward / 10.0) - 1
    
    # Height penalty: encourage stable flight heights
    height_penalty = -(y - self.helipad_y) ** 2
    height_penalty = np.tanh(height_penalty / 5.0)
    
    # Velocity penalty: discourage high velocities while allowing some movement
    velocity_penalty = -(np.abs(vx) + np.abs(vy)) ** 1.5
    velocity_penalty = np.exp(velocity_penalty / 10.0) - 1
    
    # Fuel efficiency reward: relax the fuel penalty to encourage exploration
    fuel_reward = 1 if action == 2 else 0.5
    
    # Landing reward: simplify and reduce bonus for successful landing
    landing_reward = 50 if left_leg and right_leg else 0
    
    # Total reward: a weighted sum of all components
    reward = (distance_reward * 0.3 + height_penalty * 0.2 + velocity_penalty * 0.3 + fuel_reward * 0.1 + landing_reward)
    
    # Apply a penalty if the episode is terminated (crash or out of bounds)
    if terminated and not (left_leg and right_leg):
        reward -= 50
    
    individual_reward = {
        "distance_reward": distance_reward,
        "height_penalty": height_penalty,
        "velocity_penalty": velocity_penalty,
        "fuel_reward": fuel_reward,
        "landing_reward": landing_reward,
    }
    
    return reward, individual_reward
```
This improved reward function should encourage the agent to learn more effective behaviors by:

* Balancing the distance-based reward with other components
* Encouraging stable flight heights and discouraging high velocities
* Relaxing the fuel efficiency penalty to allow for exploration
* Simplifying the landing reward component

The next training iteration can take advantage of this improved reward function, which should lead to better policy learning.
