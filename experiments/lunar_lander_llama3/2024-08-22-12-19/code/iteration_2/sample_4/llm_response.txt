Based on the provided feedback, I'll analyze each existing reward component and propose an improved reward function.

**Distance-based reward**: The values are mostly negative, which suggests that the lander is moving away from the landing pad. This could be due to the `distance_reward` being too harsh, causing the agent to avoid the area around the landing pad. I'll reduce its magnitude by a factor of 2-3.

**Height reward**: The values are mostly negative, indicating that the lander is often too high. This component seems to be doing its job well, so I won't make significant changes.

**Velocity penalty**: Similar to the distance-based reward, the values are mostly negative, suggesting that the agent's velocity is often too high. I'll reduce its magnitude by a factor of 2-3, as it might be too punishing.

**Fuel efficiency reward**: This component seems to be doing its job well, so no changes are needed.

**Landing reward**: The values are mostly positive when the lander successfully lands, and negative otherwise. This component is crucial for the agent's success. I'll increase its magnitude to make it more rewarding for successful landings.

**Episode termination penalty**: When the episode terminates due to a crash or out-of-bounds, this component applies a large penalty. While this is important, I'll reduce its magnitude slightly to avoid punishing the agent too harshly.

Based on these observations, here's a proposed improved reward function:

```python
def compute_reward(self, state, action, next_state, terminated):
    # ... (unchanged code)

    # Total reward: a weighted sum of all components
    reward = (distance_reward / 2.0
              + 0.2 * height_penalty
              + 0.5 * velocity_penalty / 2.0
              + 0.01 * fuel_penalty
              + 20.0 * landing_reward)  # Increased landing reward

    if terminated and not (left_leg and right_leg):
        reward -= 50.0  # Reduced termination penalty

    individual_reward = {
        "distance_reward": distance_reward,
        "height_penalty": height_penalty,
        "velocity_penalty": velocity_penalty,
        "fuel_penalty": fuel_penalty,
        "landing_reward": landing_reward,
    }

    return reward, individual_reward
```

This proposal aims to:

1. Reduce the magnitude of the distance-based and velocity penalty components to make them less punishing.
2. Increase the magnitude of the landing reward component to incentivize successful landings.
3. Reduce the termination penalty to avoid harshly punishing the agent for crashes or out-of-bounds episodes.

These changes should encourage the agent to move towards the landing pad, maintain a reasonable height, and achieve successful landings while using fuel efficiently.
