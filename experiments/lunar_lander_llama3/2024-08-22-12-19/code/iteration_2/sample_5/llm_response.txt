Based on the feedback provided, I will analyze each existing reward component and then write a new reward function code proposal.

**Analysis of Existing Reward Components**

1. **Distance-based reward**: The values are relatively consistent, but they seem to be too large. This could lead to overemphasis on moving towards the landing pad, which might not be ideal.
2. **Height penalty**: The values are very small, indicating that the height is well-controlled. However, the exponential function used in this component might not be necessary.
3. **Velocity penalty**: The values are also relatively consistent and seem to be reasonable. No issues found here.
4. **Fuel penalty**: This component seems to work as intended, penalizing the use of the main engine.
5. **Landing reward**: The values are high when the lander is successfully landed, which is good. However, the condition for landing might be too strict (abs(x) < 0.1 and abs(y) < 0.1).
6. **Episode termination penalty**: This component seems to work as intended, penalizing the episode if it's terminated due to a crash or out of bounds.

**New Reward Function Proposal**

Considering the analysis above, I propose the following new reward function:
```python
def compute_reward(self, state, action, next_state, terminated):
    # Unpack state variables
    x, y, vx, vy, angle, angular_velocity, left_leg, right_leg = state

    # Distance-based reward: incentivize moving towards the landing pad (scaled down)
    distance_reward = -np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2) * 0.5
    
    # Height penalty: keep the lander at a reasonable height
    height_penalty = -(y - self.helipad_y) ** 2
    height_penalty = np.tanh(height_penalty / 1.0)
    
    # Velocity penalty: discourage high velocities
    velocity_penalty = -(np.abs(vx) + np.abs(vy)) ** 2
    velocity_penalty = np.tanh(velocity_penalty / 1.0)
    
    # Fuel efficiency reward: penalize using the main engine (no change)
    fuel_penalty = -1 if action == 2 else 0
    
    # Landing reward: bonus for successful landing (more relaxed condition)
    landing_reward = 10 if left_leg and right_leg and abs(x) < 5 and abs(y) < 5 else 0
    
    # Episode termination penalty: penalize the episode if terminated due to a crash or out of bounds
    termination_penalty = -100 if terminated and not (left_leg and right_leg) else 0
    
    # Total reward: a weighted sum of all components
    reward = distance_reward + 0.2 * height_penalty + 0.5 * velocity_penalty + 0.01 * fuel_penalty + landing_reward + termination_penalty
    
    individual_reward = {
        "distance_reward": distance_reward,
        "height_penalty": height_penalty,
        "velocity_penalty": velocity_penalty,
        "fuel_penalty": fuel_penalty,
        "landing_reward": landing_reward
    }
    
    return reward, individual_reward
```
The changes I made were:

* Scaled down the distance-based reward to reduce its impact on the overall reward.
* Relaxed the condition for successful landing in the landing reward component.
* Introduced a new termination penalty component to penalize episodes terminated due to a crash or out of bounds.

These changes should help improve the learning process and encourage the agent to find better solutions.
