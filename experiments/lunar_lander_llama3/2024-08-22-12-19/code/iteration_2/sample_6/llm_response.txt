After analyzing the provided policy feedback and the existing reward function, I propose an improved reward function to better solve the task.

**Observations:**

1. The fitness score is negative, indicating that the goal is to minimize a cost rather than maximize a reward.
2. The distance-based reward and height penalty have similar magnitudes, but their scales are different.
3. The velocity penalty and fuel penalty have much larger magnitudes than the other components.
4. The landing reward is high when the lander successfully lands, but its magnitude is small compared to the other components.

**Proposal:**

To improve the reward function, I suggest the following changes:

1. Normalize the distance-based reward and height penalty by dividing them by a constant value (e.g., 100) to make their scales more comparable.
2. Reduce the magnitude of the velocity penalty and fuel penalty by multiplying them by a smaller value (e.g., 0.01).
3. Increase the magnitude of the landing reward to emphasize successful landings.

Here is the proposed new reward function:
```python
def compute_reward(self, state, action, next_state, terminated):
    # Unpack state variables
    x, y, vx, vy, angle, angular_velocity, left_leg, right_leg = state
    
    # Distance-based reward: incentivize moving towards the landing pad
    distance_reward = -np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2) / 100.0
    distance_reward = np.exp(distance_reward) - 1
    
    # Height penalty: keep the lander at a reasonable height
    height_penalty = -(y - self.helipad_y) ** 2 / 100.0
    height_penalty = np.tanh(height_penalty)
    
    # Velocity penalty: discourage high velocities
    velocity_penalty = -(np.abs(vx) + np.abs(vy)) ** 2 * 0.01
    
    # Fuel efficiency reward: penalize using the main engine
    fuel_penalty = -1 if action == 2 else 0
    
    # Landing reward: bonus for successful landing
    landing_reward = 100 if left_leg and right_leg and abs(x) < 0.1 and abs(y) < 0.1 else 10
    
    # Total reward: a weighted sum of all components
    reward = (distance_reward
              + 0.2 * height_penalty
              + 0.5 * velocity_penalty
              + 0.01 * fuel_penalty
              + landing_reward)
    
    # Apply a penalty if the episode is terminated (crash or out of bounds)
    if terminated and not (left_leg and right_leg):
        reward -= 100
    
    individual_reward = {
        "distance_reward": distance_reward,
        "height_penalty": height_penalty,
        "velocity_penalty": velocity_penalty,
        "fuel_penalty": fuel_penalty,
        "landing_reward": landing_reward,
    }
    
    return reward, individual_reward
```
This new reward function aims to strike a better balance between the different components and provides more emphasis on successful landings. The next training iteration will take advantage of this improved reward function to further refine the policy.
