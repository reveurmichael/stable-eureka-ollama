Based on the provided feedback, I'll analyze each existing reward component and propose an improved reward function.

**Analysis**

1. `distance_reward`: The values are highly negative, which indicates that the model is not encouraged to move towards the landing pad. This suggests that the scale or temperature parameter of this component might be too high.
2. `height_penalty`: The values are relatively small, but they seem to be effective in keeping the lander at a reasonable height.
3. `velocity_penalty`: Similar to `distance_reward`, the values are highly negative, suggesting that the model is discouraged from moving quickly.
4. `fuel_penalty`: This component seems to be effective in penalizing the use of the main engine.
5. `landing_reward`: The values are relatively high when the lander successfully lands, indicating that this component is effective in rewarding successful landings.

**Proposed Improved Reward Function**
```python
def compute_reward(self, state, action, next_state, terminated):
    # Unpack state variables
    x, y, vx, vy, angle, angular_velocity, left_leg, right_leg = state
    
    # Distance-based reward: incentivize moving towards the landing pad (reduced scale)
    distance_reward = -np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2) / 10.0
    
    # Height reward: keep the lander at a reasonable height
    height_penalty = -(y - self.helipad_y) ** 2
    height_penalty = np.tanh(height_penalty / 1.0)
    
    # Velocity penalty: discourage high velocities (reduced scale)
    velocity_penalty = -(np.abs(vx) + np.abs(vy)) ** 2 / 10.0
    velocity_penalty = np.tanh(velocity_penalty / 1.0)
    
    # Fuel efficiency reward: penalize using the main engine
    fuel_penalty = -1 if action == 2 else 0
    
    # Landing reward: bonus for successful landing (increased magnitude)
    landing_reward = 50 if left_leg and right_leg else 0
    
    # Total reward: a weighted sum of all components
    reward = (distance_reward + 0.3 * height_penalty + 0.6 * velocity_penalty + 0.01 * fuel_penalty + landing_reward)
    
    # Apply a penalty if the episode is terminated (crash or out of bounds)
    if terminated and not (left_leg and right_leg):
        reward -= 50
    
    individual_reward = {
        "distance_reward": distance_reward,
        "height_penalty": height_penalty,
        "velocity_penalty": velocity_penalty,
        "fuel_penalty": fuel_penalty,
        "landing_reward": landing_reward,
    }
    
    return reward, individual_reward
```
Changes:

* Reduced the scale of `distance_reward` and `velocity_penalty` to encourage more movement towards the landing pad.
* Increased the magnitude of `landing_reward` to provide a stronger incentive for successful landings.
* Kept the other components relatively unchanged.

The proposed reward function aims to strike a balance between exploration, fuel efficiency, and successful landings. It should help the model learn to navigate the environment more effectively.
