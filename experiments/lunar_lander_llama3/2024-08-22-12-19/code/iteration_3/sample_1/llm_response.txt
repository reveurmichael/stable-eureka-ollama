Analyzing the feedback:

1. The fitness score and episode length show a consistent trend, which indicates that the policy is improving.
2. The reward values have a significant range (-150 to -39), with most values being negative. This suggests that the current reward function is heavily penalizing the agent for not achieving the desired outcome.

Based on these observations, I will modify the existing reward function to better align it with the task objectives and improve the overall performance of the policy.

New Reward Function:
```
def compute_reward(self, state, action, next_state, terminated):
    # Unpack state variables
    x, y, vx, vy, angle, angular_velocity, left_leg, right_leg = state
    
    # Distance-based reward: incentivize moving towards the landing pad
    distance_reward = -np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    distance_reward = np.exp(distance_reward / 50.0) - 1  # Reduced temperature to encourage exploration
    
    # Height reward: keep the lander at a reasonable height
    height_penalty = -(y - self.helipad_y) ** 2
    height_penalty = np.tanh(height_penalty / 1.5)  # Increased temperature to discourage high altitudes
    
    # Velocity penalty: discourage high velocities
    velocity_penalty = -(np.abs(vx) + np.abs(vy)) ** 2
    velocity_penalty = np.tanh(velocity_penalty / 0.8)  # Reduced temperature to encourage faster descent
    
    # Fuel efficiency reward: penalize using the main engine
    fuel_penalty = -1 if action == 2 else 0
    
    # Landing reward: bonus for successful landing
    landing_reward = 100 if left_leg and right_leg else 0
    
    # Total reward: a weighted sum of all components
    reward = (distance_reward
              + 0.3 * height_penalty  # Increased weight on height penalty
              + 0.4 * velocity_penalty  # Increased weight on velocity penalty
              + 0.01 * fuel_penalty
              + landing_reward)
    
    # Apply a penalty if the episode is terminated (crash or out of bounds)
    if terminated and not (left_leg and right_leg):
        reward -= 100
    
    individual_reward = {
        "distance_reward": distance_reward,
        "height_penalty": height_penalty,
        "velocity_penalty": velocity_penalty,
        "fuel_penalty": fuel_penalty,
        "landing_reward": landing_reward,
    }
    
    return reward, individual_reward
```
Key changes:

* Reduced the temperature of the distance-based reward to encourage exploration.
* Increased the weight on the height and velocity penalties to discourage high altitudes and velocities.
* Kept the fuel efficiency penalty the same, as it's still important to conserve fuel.

These modifications should help the policy learn to navigate the environment more effectively and achieve a higher fitness score.
