Analyzing the policy feedback:

1. The distance-based reward has a large range (-28.0 to -39.66), which might make it difficult for the agent to learn. Considering option (a) or (b) to re-scale or re-write this component.

2. The height penalty has a moderate range (-24.0 to 0). This looks reasonable, but if the agent is not learning well, consider adjusting its scale or temperature parameter.

3. The velocity penalty also has a moderate range (-134.2 to -101.5), which might be too large for the agent to learn effectively. Considering option (a) or (b) to re-scale or re-write this component.

4. The fuel efficiency reward is very negative when using the main engine, which should encourage the agent to avoid it. This looks good!

5. The landing reward is high for successful landings and low otherwise. This should motivate the agent to land safely.

Now, let's write a new reward function proposal:

```
def compute_reward(self, state, action, next_state, terminated):
    # Unpack state variables
    x, y, vx, vy, angle, angular_velocity, left_leg, right_leg = state

    # Distance-based reward: incentivize moving towards the landing pad with a smaller range
    distance_reward = -np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2) / 10.0
    
    # Height reward: keep the lander at a reasonable height with a moderate penalty for large deviations
    height_penalty = -(y - self.helipad_y)**2 * 0.5
    
    # Velocity penalty: discourage high velocities but not too harshly
    velocity_penalty = -(np.abs(vx) + np.abs(vy)) ** 2 * 0.1
    
    # Fuel efficiency reward: penalize using the main engine strongly
    fuel_penalty = -10 if action == 2 else 0
    
    # Landing reward: bonus for successful landing with a smaller range
    landing_reward = 50 if left_leg and right_leg else 0
    
    # Total reward: a weighted sum of all components
    reward = (distance_reward
              + 0.3 * height_penalty
              + 0.2 * velocity_penalty
              + 0.05 * fuel_penalty
              + landing_reward)
    
    # Apply a penalty if the episode is terminated (crash or out of bounds)
    if terminated and not (left_leg and right_leg):
        reward -= 50
    
    individual_reward = {
        "distance_reward": distance_reward,
        "height_penalty": height_penalty,
        "velocity_penalty": velocity_penalty,
        "fuel_penalty": fuel_penalty,
        "landing_reward": landing_reward,
    }
    
    return reward, individual_reward
```

This new proposal reduces the magnitude of the negative rewards and increases the weights for the more desirable states (distance to the landing pad, being close to the ground, and having low velocities). The penalty for using the main engine is also stronger.
