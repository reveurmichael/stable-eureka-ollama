Let's analyze each existing reward component:

1. **Distance-based reward**: The values are not identical, but they are all negative and increase when the distance to the landing pad increases. This suggests that the goal is to move closer to the landing pad, which is correct. However, the exponential scaling might be too strong, making it difficult for the agent to learn.

2. **Height reward**: The values are all negative and decrease as the height above the landing pad decreases. This is good, but the tanh scaling might be too strong, causing the agent to focus too much on maintaining a specific height.

3. **Velocity penalty**: The values are all negative and increase with velocity. This is good, as it discourages high velocities.

4. **Fuel efficiency reward**: The values are binary (0 or -1), indicating that using the main engine should be avoided.

5. **Landing reward**: The values are 0 unless the agent lands successfully, in which case they are 10 or 100. This is good, as it provides a strong incentive for successful landings.

6. **Termination penalty**: If the episode terminates due to crash or out of bounds, a large negative reward is applied. This is necessary to discourage such outcomes.

Based on this analysis, I propose the following improved reward function:
```python
def compute_reward(self, state, action, next_state, terminated):
    # Unpack state variables
    x, y, vx, vy, angle, angular_velocity, left_leg, right_leg = state

    # Distance-based reward: incentivize moving towards the landing pad
    distance_reward = -np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    distance_reward = np.tanh(distance_reward / 10.0)  # reduce scaling to make it easier for the agent to learn

    # Height reward: keep the lander at a reasonable height
    height_penalty = -(y - self.helipad_y) ** 2
    height_penalty = 1 - np.exp(-height_penalty / 5.0)  # invert and scale the penalty to encourage a target height

    # Velocity penalty: discourage high velocities
    velocity_penalty = -(np.abs(vx) + np.abs(vy)) ** 2
    velocity_penalty = np.tanh(velocity_penalty / 1.0)

    # Fuel efficiency reward: penalize using the main engine
    fuel_penalty = -1 if action == 2 else 0

    # Landing reward: bonus for successful landing
    landing_reward = 100 if left_leg and right_leg:
        if abs(x) < 0.1 and abs(y) < 0.1:  # adjust the landing zone to make it smaller
            return 100
        elif abs(x) < 0.5 or abs(y) < 0.5:  # provide a smaller bonus for almost landing
            return 10
    else:
        landing_reward = 0

    # Termination penalty: apply a large negative reward if the episode terminates due to crash or out of bounds
    termination_penalty = -100 if terminated and not (left_leg and right_leg):  # adjust the magnitude of this penalty
    else:
        termination_penalty = 0

    # Total reward: a weighted sum of all components
    reward = distance_reward + 0.3 * height_penalty + 0.4 * velocity_penalty - 0.05 * fuel_penalty + landing_reward + termination_penalty

    individual_reward = {
        "distance_reward": distance_reward,
        "height_penalty": height_penalty,
        "velocity_penalty": velocity_penalty,
        "fuel_penalty": fuel_penalty,
        "landing_reward": landing_reward,
    }

    return reward, individual_reward
```
I made the following changes:

* Reduced the scaling of the distance-based reward to make it easier for the agent to learn.
* Inverted and scaled the height penalty to encourage a target height rather than discouraging all heights above the target.
* Adjusted the landing reward to provide a smaller bonus for almost landing, making it more challenging to achieve perfect landings.
* Increased the magnitude of the termination penalty to discourage crashes or out-of-bounds episodes.

These changes should improve the agent's performance and encourage more successful landings.
