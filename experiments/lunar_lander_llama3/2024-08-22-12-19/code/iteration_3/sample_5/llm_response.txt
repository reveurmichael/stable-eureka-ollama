Based on the provided feedback, I will analyze each existing reward component and then write a new reward function code proposal.

**Analysis of Existing Reward Components**

1. **Distance-based reward**: The magnitude of this component is quite large (-100 to -39), which might dominate other components. This could be re-scaled or modified.
2. **Height penalty**: This component seems to be well-behaved, but its mean value is negative (-131). This could be further investigated for improvement.
3. **Velocity penalty**: The magnitude of this component is also quite large (-150 to -101), which might dominate other components. This could be re-scaled or modified.
4. **Fuel penalty**: This component seems simple and well-behaved, but its mean value is negative (-86). This could be further investigated for improvement.
5. **Landing reward**: The magnitude of this component is relatively small (0 to 100), which might not have a significant impact on the overall reward. This could be re-weighted or modified.

**New Reward Function Code Proposal**

Considering the analysis above, I propose the following new reward function code:
```python
def compute_reward(self, state, action, next_state, terminated):
    # Unpack state variables
    x, y, vx, vy, angle, angular_velocity, left_leg, right_leg = state
    
    # Distance-based reward: incentivize moving towards the landing pad
    distance_reward = -np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    distance_reward = np.tanh(distance_reward / 50.0) * 10.0
    
    # Height reward: keep the lander at a reasonable height
    height_penalty = -(y - self.helipad_y) ** 2
    height_penalty = np.tanh(height_penalty / 1.5)
    
    # Velocity penalty: discourage high velocities
    velocity_penalty = -(np.abs(vx) + np.abs(vy)) ** 2
    velocity_penalty = np.tanh(velocity_penalty / 2.0) * -10.0
    
    # Fuel efficiency reward: penalize using the main engine (re-weighted)
    fuel_penalty = -1 if action == 2 else 0
    fuel_penalty *= -5.0
    
    # Landing reward: bonus for successful landing
    landing_reward = 0
    if left_leg and right_leg:
        landing_reward = 50 if abs(x) < 0.1 and abs(y) < 0.1 else 10
    
    # Total reward: a weighted sum of all components
    reward = (distance_reward * 0.3
              + height_penalty * 0.2
              + velocity_penalty * 0.4
              + fuel_penalty * 0.1
              + landing_reward)
    
    # Apply a penalty if the episode is terminated (crash or out of bounds)
    if terminated and not (left_leg and right_leg):
        reward -= 50
    
    individual_reward = {
        "distance_reward": distance_reward,
        "height_penalty": height_penalty,
        "velocity_penalty": velocity_penalty,
        "fuel_penalty": fuel_penalty,
        "landing_reward": landing_reward,
    }
    
    return reward, individual_reward
```
**Changes**

1. Re-scaled the distance-based reward to reduce its magnitude.
2. Adjusted the weight of the height penalty component.
3. Reduced the magnitude of the velocity penalty component.
4. Re-weighted the fuel efficiency reward component.
5. Increased the bonus for successful landing (re-weighted).

The new reward function code proposal aims to balance the different components and provide a more nuanced reward signal for the agent to learn from.
