After analyzing the feedback and the existing reward function, I've identified some issues that need to be addressed:

1. The `distance_reward` component has a significant impact on the overall reward, which may not be desirable. A distance-based reward could lead to an overemphasis on getting close to the landing pad without considering other important factors.
2. The `height_penalty` and `velocity_penalty` components have similar magnitudes and can cancel each other out, making it challenging for the agent to learn a good policy.
3. The `fuel_penalty` component is too harsh, as it assigns a reward of -1 whenever the main engine is used. This could lead to an over-reliance on the secondary engines, which may not be desirable.
4. The `landing_reward` component is not well-defined, as it only rewards successful landings when both legs are on the ground.

To address these issues, I propose the following improved reward function:

```
def compute_reward(self, state, action, next_state, terminated):
    # Unpack state variables
    x, y, vx, vy, angle, angular_velocity, left_leg, right_leg = state

    # Distance-based reward: incentivize moving towards the landing pad with a moderate strength
    distance_reward = -np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    distance_reward = np.tanh(distance_reward / 20.0) * 5.0

    # Height reward: keep the lander at a reasonable height with a stronger penalty
    height_penalty = -(y - self.helipad_y) ** 2
    height_penalty = np.tanh(height_penalty / 5.0) * 10.0

    # Velocity penalty: discourage high velocities with a moderate strength
    velocity_penalty = -(np.abs(vx) + np.abs(vy)) ** 2
    velocity_penalty = np.tanh(velocity_penalty / 20.0) * 5.0

    # Fuel efficiency reward: penalize using the main engine, but not too harshly
    fuel_penalty = -0.1 if action == 2 else 0

    # Landing reward: bonus for successful landing, with a more defined condition
    landing_reward = 100 if left_leg and right_leg and abs(x) < 0.5 and abs(y) < 0.5 else 10

    # Total reward: a weighted sum of all components
    reward = (distance_reward
              + 0.3 * height_penalty
              + 0.2 * velocity_penalty
              + 0.05 * fuel_penalty
              + landing_reward)

    # Apply a penalty if the episode is terminated (crash or out of bounds)
    if terminated and not (left_leg and right_leg):
        reward -= 50

    individual_reward = {
        "distance_reward": distance_reward,
        "height_penalty": height_penalty,
        "velocity_penalty": velocity_penalty,
        "fuel_penalty": fuel_penalty,
        "landing_reward": landing_reward,
    }

    return reward, individual_reward
```

This revised reward function aims to:

* Reduce the impact of the `distance_reward` component by making it more moderate.
* Strengthen the `height_penalty` and `velocity_penalty` components to encourage more stable flight.
* Make the `fuel_penalty` component less harsh, as we want to discourage main engine usage but not punish it too heavily.
* Define a more specific condition for the `landing_reward`, focusing on successful landings with both legs on the ground.

By using these adjustments, I hope to improve the agent's performance and encourage more effective exploration of the environment.
