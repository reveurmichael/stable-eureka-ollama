A challenging task! Based on the provided policy feedback, I'll analyze each existing reward component and propose improvements.

**Distance-based reward**: The values are nearly identical, which might indicate that the distance reward is not providing sufficient incentives to move towards the landing pad. Consider scaling it up or introducing a temperature parameter to make the agent's progress more meaningful.

**Height reward**: The penalty term seems reasonable, but the tanh function might be too aggressive. A smaller tanh value (e.g., 0.5) could help.

**Velocity penalty**: Similar to the distance-based reward, the values are very similar. This might indicate that the velocity penalty is not strong enough. Consider increasing its magnitude or introducing a temperature parameter.

**Fuel efficiency reward**: The penalty term seems straightforward and effective. Keep it as is!

**Landing reward**: This component seems well-designed, with a significant bonus for successful landings. Keep it as is!

**Total reward**: The weighted sum of the components looks reasonable. However, consider normalizing the individual rewards to ensure they contribute equally to the total reward.

Based on these insights, I propose an updated reward function:
```python
def compute_reward(self, state, action, next_state, terminated):
    # ... (same as before)

    # Distance-based reward: incentivize moving towards the landing pad
    distance_reward = -np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2) * 5.0  # scale up

    # Height reward: keep the lander at a reasonable height
    height_penalty = -(y - self.helipad_y) ** 2 * 0.5  # reduce tanh effect

    # Velocity penalty: discourage high velocities
    velocity_penalty = -(np.abs(vx) + np.abs(vy)) ** 2 * 1.5  # increase magnitude

    # Total reward: a weighted sum of all components (normalized)
    reward = (distance_reward / 100.0 +
              height_penalty / 10.0 +
              velocity_penalty / 50.0 +
              fuel_penalty + landing_reward)

    if terminated and not (left_leg and right_leg):
        reward -= 100

    individual_reward = {
        "distance_reward": distance_reward,
        "height_penalty": height_penalty,
        "velocity_penalty": velocity_penalty,
        "fuel_penalty": fuel_penalty,
        "landing_reward": landing_reward,
    }

    return reward, individual_reward
```
By scaling up the distance-based reward and reducing the tanh effect in the height penalty, we should encourage the agent to move closer to the landing pad. Increasing the magnitude of the velocity penalty will discourage high velocities. Normalizing the individual rewards ensures they contribute equally to the total reward.

Please note that these changes are just proposals based on my analysis. You may need to experiment with different values and combinations to find the best balance for your specific task.
