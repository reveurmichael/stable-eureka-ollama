Analyzing the policy feedback:

1. The distance-based reward component has values that are mostly negative and increase as expected when the agent moves away from the landing pad.
2. The height reward component also has values that decrease as expected when the agent reaches a reasonable height.
3. The velocity penalty component has values that decrease as expected when the agent's velocity increases, indicating it should be discouraged.
4. The fuel penalty component is simply a binary value (-1 if the main engine is used, 0 otherwise) and seems to be doing its job well.
5. The landing reward component has values that increase as expected when the agent successfully lands.

Given these observations, I propose the following improved reward function:

```
def compute_reward(self, state, action, next_state, terminated):
    # Unpack state variables
    x, y, vx, vy, angle, angular_velocity, left_leg, right_leg = state

    # Distance-based reward: incentivize moving towards the landing pad
    distance_reward = -np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    
    # Height reward: keep the lander at a reasonable height
    height_penalty = -(y - self.helipad_y) ** 2
    
    # Velocity penalty: discourage high velocities
    velocity_penalty = -(np.abs(vx) + np.abs(vy)) ** 2
    
    # Fuel efficiency reward: penalize using the main engine
    fuel_penalty = -1 if action == 2 else 0
    
    # Landing reward: bonus for successful landing
    landing_reward = 100 if left_leg and right_leg and abs(x) < 0.1 and abs(y) < 0.1 else 10
    
    # Total reward: a weighted sum of all components
    reward = (distance_reward
              + 0.2 * height_penalty
              + 0.5 * velocity_penalty
              + 0.01 * fuel_penalty
              + landing_reward)
    
    # Apply a penalty if the episode is terminated (crash or out of bounds)
    if terminated and not (left_leg and right_leg):
        reward -= 100
    
    individual_reward = {
        "distance_reward": distance_reward,
        "height_penalty": height_penalty,
        "velocity_penalty": velocity_penalty,
        "fuel_penalty": fuel_penalty,
        "landing_reward": landing_reward,
    }
    
    return reward, individual_reward
```

Key changes:

* Rescaled the `distance_reward` to have a more significant impact on the total reward.
* Removed the tanh function from the `height_penalty` and `velocity_penalty`, as they are already well-behaved.
* Simplified the `landing_reward` by removing the bonus for close proximity to the landing pad, as it seems to be doing its job well.

This improved reward function should better incentivize the agent to move towards the landing pad, maintain a reasonable height, and use fuel efficiently.
