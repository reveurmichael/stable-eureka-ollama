Analyzing the policy feedback:

1. The distance-based reward and height penalty components have similar values, indicating that they may not be providing enough contrast for the agent to learn effectively. This could be due to the scale or temperature parameter of these components.

2. The velocity penalty component has a much larger magnitude than other components, which may dominate the reward signal. Rescaling this component is necessary to maintain a balance with other components.

3. The fuel penalty and landing reward components have small and consistent values throughout the training process. These components do not appear to be having a significant impact on the agent's behavior.

4. The fitness score has not been improving during training, indicating that the current reward function may not be providing an effective signal for the agent to learn.

5. Since the goal is to maximize the fitness score, we want to focus on designing a new reward function that encourages the agent to improve its performance.

New Reward Function Proposal:

1. Distance-based reward: This component should incentivize moving towards the landing pad while maintaining some scaling and temperature parameter adjustments.

2. Velocity penalty: Rescale this component to maintain balance with other components.

3. Fuel efficiency reward: Introduce a new fuel-efficient component that rewards the agent for reducing its velocity when it's close to the landing pad.

4. Landing bonus: Increase the magnitude of the landing reward to provide more incentive for successful landings.

Here is the new reward function code proposal:

```
def compute_reward(self, state, action, next_state, terminated):
    # Unpack state variables
    x, y, vx, vy, angle, angular_velocity, left_leg, right_leg = state
    
    # Distance-based reward: incentivize moving towards the landing pad
    distance_reward = -np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    distance_reward = np.exp(distance_reward / 50.0) - 1
    
    # Velocity penalty: discourage high velocities
    velocity_penalty = -(np.abs(vx) + np.abs(vy)) ** 2
    velocity_penalty = np.tanh(velocity_penalty / 5.0)
    
    # Fuel efficiency reward: penalize using the main engine when close to the landing pad
    fuel_efficiency_reward = -1 if action == 2 and np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2) < 10 else 0
    
    # Landing bonus: reward successful landings
    landing_bonus = 100 if left_leg and right_leg and abs(x) < 0.5 and abs(y) < 0.5 else 10
    
    # Total reward: a weighted sum of all components
    reward = (distance_reward
              + 0.1 * velocity_penalty
              + 0.05 * fuel_efficiency_reward
              + landing_bonus)
    
    # Apply a penalty if the episode is terminated (crash or out of bounds)
    if terminated and not (left_leg and right_leg):
        reward -= 50
    
    individual_reward = {
        "distance_reward": distance_reward,
        "velocity_penalty": velocity_penalty,
        "fuel_efficiency_reward": fuel_efficiency_reward,
        "landing_bonus": landing_bonus,
    }
    
    return reward, individual_reward
```

This new reward function aims to provide a more effective signal for the agent to learn and improve its performance. The next training will take the best model weights, incorporating some relevant information from previous training!
