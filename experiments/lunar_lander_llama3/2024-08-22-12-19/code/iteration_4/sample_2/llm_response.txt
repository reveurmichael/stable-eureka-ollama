Based on the analysis of the policy feedback, I propose the following improved reward function:

```Python
def compute_reward(self, state, action, next_state, terminated):
    # Unpack state variables
    x, y, vx, vy, angle, angular_velocity, left_leg, right_leg = state
    
    # Distance-based reward: incentivize moving towards the landing pad
    distance_reward = -np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    
    # Height reward: keep the lander at a reasonable height
    height_penalty = -(y - self.helipad_y) ** 2
    height_penalty = np.tanh(height_penalty / 1.0)
    
    # Velocity penalty: discourage high velocities
    velocity_penalty = -(np.abs(vx) + np.abs(vy)) ** 2
    velocity_penalty = np.tanh(velocity_penalty / 1.0)
    
    # Fuel efficiency reward: penalize using the main engine
    fuel_penalty = -1 if action == 2 else 0
    
    # Landing reward: bonus for successful landing
    landing_reward = 100 if abs(x) < 0.1 and abs(y) < 0.1 else 10
    
    # Termination penalty: penalize for crash or out of bounds
    termination_penalty = -50 if terminated and not (left_leg and right_leg) else 0
    
    # Total reward: a weighted sum of all components
    reward = distance_reward + 0.3 * height_penalty + 0.6 * velocity_penalty + fuel_penalty + landing_reward + termination_penalty
    
    individual_reward = {
        "distance_reward": distance_reward,
        "height_penalty": height_penalty,
        "velocity_penalty": velocity_penalty,
        "fuel_penalty": fuel_penalty,
        "landing_reward": landing_reward,
        "termination_penalty": termination_penalty
    }
    
    return reward, individual_reward
```

I made the following changes:

1. Reduced the magnitude of the distance-based reward component by a factor of 10 to make it more comparable with other components.
2. Increased the weight of the height penalty from 0.2 to 0.3 to emphasize the importance of keeping the lander at a reasonable height.
3. Increased the weight of the velocity penalty from 0.5 to 0.6 to discourage high velocities.
4. Introduced a termination penalty component to penalize for crash or out of bounds, which is not present in the original reward function.

These changes are aimed at improving the overall performance of the policy by providing more balanced rewards and penalties.
