Based on the provided feedback, I'll analyze each existing reward component and propose improvements.

**1. Distance-based reward:** The values are not identical (range: -24.0 to 28.0), but it seems to increase when it should decrease (minimize). This might be due to the exponential scaling (`np.exp`). To improve this, I'll consider changing its scale or temperature parameter.

**2. Height reward:** The values are highly negative (range: -0.1 to -1.0), indicating that the lander is not staying at a reasonable height. This component seems to be effective in discouraging high altitudes.

**3. Velocity penalty:** The values are mostly negative, with a range of (-101.5, -39.7). This suggests that velocities are indeed being discouraged. However, the magnitude is significant, so I'll consider re-scaling this component.

**4. Fuel efficiency reward:** The values are binary (0 or -1), indicating that using the main engine is heavily penalized. This seems to be an effective way to encourage fuel efficiency.

**5. Landing reward:** The values are mostly 0, with a few high values when the lander successfully lands. This component seems to be effective in encouraging successful landings.

Based on these observations, I'll propose a new reward function:

```python
def compute_reward(self, state, action, next_state, terminated):
    # Unpack state variables
    x, y, vx, vy, angle, angular_velocity, left_leg, right_leg = state

    # Distance-based reward: incentivize moving towards the landing pad (reduced scale)
    distance_reward = -np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2) / 5.0

    # Height reward: keep the lander at a reasonable height
    height_penalty = -(y - self.helipad_y) ** 2

    # Velocity penalty: discourage high velocities (reduced magnitude)
    velocity_penalty = -(np.abs(vx) + np.abs(vy)) ** 2 / 10.0

    # Fuel efficiency reward: penalize using the main engine
    fuel_penalty = -1 if action == 2 else 0

    # Landing reward: bonus for successful landing (increased magnitude)
    landing_reward = 100 if left_leg and right_leg and abs(x) < 0.1 and abs(y) < 0.1 else 10

    # Total reward: a weighted sum of all components
    reward = distance_reward + 0.2 * height_penalty - 0.5 * velocity_penalty - 0.01 * fuel_penalty + landing_reward

    # Apply a penalty if the episode is terminated (crash or out of bounds)
    if terminated and not (left_leg and right_leg):
        reward -= 100

    individual_reward = {
        "distance_reward": distance_reward,
        "height_penalty": height_penalty,
        "velocity_penalty": velocity_penalty,
        "fuel_penalty": fuel_penalty,
        "landing_reward": landing_reward,
    }

    return reward, individual_reward
```

The main changes are:

1. Reduced the scale of the distance-based reward to focus more on proximity to the landing pad.
2. Re-scaled the velocity penalty to make it less severe.
3. Increased the magnitude of the landing reward to emphasize successful landings.

These changes should help improve the overall performance of the agent and encourage more effective exploration and exploitation strategies.
