Based on the provided policy feedback, I'll analyze each existing reward component and provide suggestions for improvement.

1. **Distance-based reward**: The values are mostly negative, which means the agent is moving away from the landing pad. To encourage movement towards the landing pad, we can re-scale this component or add a temperature parameter to make it more prominent.
2. **Height reward**: This component seems to be working correctly, as the values are mainly around -1 (near the landing pad) and increase when the lander is higher. No changes needed here.
3. **Velocity penalty**: The values are mostly negative, which means the agent is not penalized enough for having high velocities. We can re-scale this component to make it more significant.
4. **Fuel efficiency reward**: This component seems to be working correctly, as the agent is penalized when using the main engine unnecessarily. No changes needed here.
5. **Landing reward**: The values are mostly around 0 or 10, which means the agent is not incentivized enough for successful landings. We can increase the reward value or add a temperature parameter to make it more prominent.

Considering the policy feedback, I'll propose an improved reward function:

```python
def compute_reward(self, state, action, next_state, terminated):
    # Unpack state variables
    x, y, vx, vy, angle, angular_velocity, left_leg, right_leg = state
    
    # Distance-based reward: incentivize moving towards the landing pad (scale increased)
    distance_reward = -np.exp(-100 * np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2))
    
    # Height reward: keep the lander at a reasonable height
    height_penalty = -(y - self.helipad_y) ** 2
    height_penalty = np.tanh(height_penalty / 1.0)
    
    # Velocity penalty: discourage high velocities (scale increased)
    velocity_penalty = -(np.abs(vx) + np.abs(vy)) ** 4
    velocity_penalty = np.tanh(velocity_penalty / 1.0)
    
    # Fuel efficiency reward: penalize using the main engine
    fuel_penalty = -1 if action == 2 else 0
    
    # Landing reward: bonus for successful landing (reward increased)
    landing_reward = 100 if left_leg and right_leg else 10
    
    # Total reward: a weighted sum of all components
    reward = (distance_reward
              + 0.3 * height_penalty
              + 0.7 * velocity_penalty
              + 0.01 * fuel_penalty
              + landing_reward)
    
    # Apply a penalty if the episode is terminated (crash or out of bounds)
    if terminated and not (left_leg and right_leg):
        reward -= 100
    
    individual_reward = {
        "distance_reward": distance_reward,
        "height_penalty": height_penalty,
        "velocity_penalty": velocity_penalty,
        "fuel_penalty": fuel_penalty,
        "landing_reward": landing_reward,
    }
    
    return reward, individual_reward
```

The proposed changes include:

* Increasing the scale of the distance-based and velocity penalty components to make them more prominent.
* Increasing the reward value for successful landings (landing_reward).
* Keeping the height penalty and fuel efficiency rewards unchanged, as they seem to be working correctly.

These changes should improve the agent's performance in navigating the landing pad and avoiding crashes.
