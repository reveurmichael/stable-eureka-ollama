Based on the provided policy feedback, I'll analyze each existing reward component and propose an improved reward function.

1. **Distance-based reward**: The values are quite high and decreasing (minimizing). This suggests that the lander is moving away from the landing pad instead of approaching it. To fix this, I'll change the scale by reducing the magnitude of the reward.
2. **Height reward**: The values seem reasonable, but the magnitude is significantly larger than other components. I'll rescale it to be more comparable with other components.
3. **Velocity penalty**: The values are quite high and decreasing (minimizing). This suggests that the lander is moving too fast instead of slowing down. To fix this, I'll change the scale by reducing the magnitude of the reward.
4. **Fuel penalty**: The values are low and constant. This suggests that using the main engine is not discouraged enough. To fix this, I'll increase the magnitude of the penalty to discourage fuel usage.
5. **Landing reward**: The values are high when the lander successfully lands, but the magnitude is quite low compared to other components. I'll increase the magnitude of the reward to make it more significant.

Considering these findings, here's my proposed improved reward function:

```python
def compute_reward(self, state, action, next_state, terminated):
    # Unpack state variables
    x, y, vx, vy, angle, angular_velocity, left_leg, right_leg = state

    # Distance-based reward: incentivize moving towards the landing pad
    distance_reward = -np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2) / 10.0  # reduced magnitude

    # Height reward: keep the lander at a reasonable height (rescaled)
    height_penalty = -(y - self.helipad_y) ** 2 * 0.1

    # Velocity penalty: discourage high velocities
    velocity_penalty = -(np.abs(vx) + np.abs(vy)) ** 2 / 10.0  # reduced magnitude

    # Fuel penalty: strongly penalize using the main engine
    fuel_penalty = -5 if action == 2 else 0

    # Landing reward: significant bonus for successful landing
    landing_reward = 50 if left_leg and right_leg:
        abs(x) < 0.1 and abs(y) < 0.1 else 0

    # Total reward: a weighted sum of all components
    reward = (distance_reward + 
              0.2 * height_penalty + 
              0.5 * velocity_penalty + 
              0.01 * fuel_penalty + 
              landing_reward)
    
    # Apply a penalty if the episode is terminated (crash or out of bounds)
    if terminated and not (left_leg and right_leg):
        reward -= 100
    
    individual_reward = {
        "distance_reward": distance_reward,
        "height_penalty": height_penalty,
        "velocity_penalty": velocity_penalty,
        "fuel_penalty": fuel_penalty,
        "landing_reward": landing_reward,
    }
    
    return reward, individual_reward
```

This improved reward function should encourage the lander to move towards the landing pad, maintain a reasonable height, slow down its velocity, and use its main engine efficiently.
