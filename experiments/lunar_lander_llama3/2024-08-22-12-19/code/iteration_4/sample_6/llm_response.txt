Based on the analysis of the policy feedback, I propose an improved reward function to better solve the task. Here's my thought process:

1. The `distance_reward` component seems to be doing its job well, as it decreases when the lander moves away from the landing pad.
2. The `height_penalty` component appears to be too strong, as it heavily penalizes deviations from the target height. I'll reduce its magnitude and consider using a different function that's less sensitive to height variations.
3. The `velocity_penalty` component seems reasonable, but its magnitude is quite large. I'll scale it down to focus more on velocity rather than punishing high velocities excessively.
4. The `fuel_penalty` component appears to be doing its job well, as it penalizes using the main engine.
5. The `landing_reward` component seems a bit weak, so I'll increase its magnitude and consider adding more conditions for successful landing.
6. The overall reward function is a weighted sum of these components. I'll adjust the weights to balance the importance of each component.

Here's my proposed improved reward function code:
```python
def compute_reward(self, state, action, next_state, terminated):
    # Unpack state variables
    x, y, vx, vy, angle, angular_velocity, left_leg, right_leg = state

    # Distance-based reward: incentivize moving towards the landing pad
    distance_reward = -np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    distance_reward = np.exp(distance_reward / 100.0) - 1

    # Height reward: keep the lander at a reasonable height with a softer penalty
    height_penalty = -(y - self.helipad_y) ** 2 / 10.0
    height_penalty = np.tanh(height_penalty)

    # Velocity penalty: discourage high velocities, but not too harshly
    velocity_penalty = -(np.abs(vx) + np.abs(vy)) ** 1.5
    velocity_penalty = np.tanh(velocity_penalty / 2.0)

    # Fuel efficiency reward: penalize using the main engine
    fuel_penalty = -1 if action == 2 else 0

    # Landing reward: bonus for successful landing with a stronger incentive
    landing_reward = 100 if left_leg and right_leg and abs(x) < 0.05 and abs(y) < 0.05 else 20

    # Total reward: a weighted sum of all components
    reward = (distance_reward
              + 0.3 * height_penalty
              + 0.2 * velocity_penalty
              + 0.01 * fuel_penalty
              + landing_reward)

    # Apply a penalty if the episode is terminated (crash or out of bounds)
    if terminated and not (left_leg and right_leg):
        reward -= 50

    individual_reward = {
        "distance_reward": distance_reward,
        "height_penalty": height_penalty,
        "velocity_penalty": velocity_penalty,
        "fuel_penalty": fuel_penalty,
        "landing_reward": landing_reward,
    }

    return reward, individual_reward
```
This improved reward function code proposal aims to better balance the importance of each component and provide a stronger incentive for successful landing. I hope this helps improve the performance of your reinforcement learning model!
