A great opportunity to analyze and improve the policy feedback!

From the analysis, I can see that:

1. The "distance_reward" component has values ranging from -39.66 to -105.55, which are quite spread out. This suggests that this component might be over-emphasizing the distance metric.
2. The "height_penalty" and "velocity_penalty" components have similar magnitudes, but their signs are opposite. This could indicate that the model is having trouble balancing these two metrics.
3. The "fuel_penalty" component has values ranging from -1 to 0, which suggests that it's not having a significant impact on the overall reward.
4. The "landing_reward" component only has positive values when the lander successfully lands, which is good! However, its magnitude is relatively small compared to other components.

Considering these observations, I propose an updated reward function:

```python
def compute_reward(self, state, action, next_state, terminated):
    # Unpack state variables
    x, y, vx, vy, angle, angular_velocity, left_leg, right_leg = state
    
    # Distance-based reward: incentivize moving towards the landing pad (scaled down)
    distance_reward = -np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2) / 500.0
    
    # Height reward: keep the lander at a reasonable height (modified to balance with velocity penalty)
    height_penalty = -(y - self.helipad_y) ** 2 * 0.3
    
    # Velocity penalty: discourage high velocities (reduced magnitude)
    velocity_penalty = -(np.abs(vx) + np.abs(vy)) ** 2 * 0.1
    
    # Fuel efficiency reward: penalize using the main engine (increased magnitude to make it more impactful)
    fuel_penalty = -5 if action == 2 else 0
    
    # Landing reward: bonus for successful landing (maintained magnitude)
    landing_reward = 0
    if left_leg and right_leg:
        landing_reward = 100 if abs(x) < 0.1 and abs(y) < 0.1 else 10
    
    # Total reward: a weighted sum of all components
    reward = distance_reward + height_penalty + velocity_penalty - fuel_penalty + landing_reward
    
    # Apply a penalty if the episode is terminated (crash or out of bounds)
    if terminated and not (left_leg and right_leg):
        reward -= 100
    
    individual_reward = {
        "distance_reward": distance_reward,
        "height_penalty": height_penalty,
        "velocity_penalty": velocity_penalty,
        "fuel_penalty": fuel_penalty,
        "landing_reward": landing_reward,
    }
    
    return reward, individual_reward
```

The main changes are:

* Reduced the magnitude of the "distance_reward" component to make it less dominant.
* Modified the "height_penalty" and "velocity_penalty" components to balance their magnitudes and signs.
* Increased the magnitude of the "fuel_penalty" component to make it more impactful.
* Kept the magnitude of the "landing_reward" component unchanged.

This updated reward function should help the model focus on balancing distance, height, velocity, fuel efficiency, and landing success while training.
