Here's an alternative reward proposal:

```
def compute_reward(self, state, m_power, s_power, terminated):
    # Unpack state variables
    x, y, vx, vy, angle, angular_velocity, left_leg, right_leg = state

    # Distance-based reward: incentivize moving towards the landing pad
    distance_reward = -np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)

    # Stability reward: penalize tilting and angular velocity
    angle_stability = np.cos(np.abs(angle) / 0.1)
    angular_velocity_penalty = -np.exp(-angular_velocity**2 / (0.5**2))

    # Velocity reward: penalize high velocities, but encourage a gentle landing
    velocity_reward = -(vx**2 + vy**2)**0.5

    # Fuel efficiency reward: incentivize using the side engines and main engine equally
    fuel_efficiency = np.exp(-m_power / (1 + s_power))

    # Landing bonus: reward successful landings
    landing_bonus = 100 if left_leg and right_leg else 0

    # Total reward: a weighted sum of all components
    reward = distance_reward * 0.5 + angle_stability * 0.2 + angular_velocity_penalty * 0.1 + velocity_reward * 0.2 + fuel_efficiency * 0.3 + landing_bonus

    individual_reward = {
        "distance_reward": distance_reward,
        "angle_stability": angle_stability,
        "angular_velocity_penalty": angular_velocity_penalty,
        "velocity_reward": velocity_reward,
        "fuel_efficiency": fuel_efficiency,
        "landing_bonus": landing_bonus
    }

    return reward, individual_reward
```

This alternative proposal provides a different set of rewards and penalties to guide the lander's behavior. The `distance_reward` still incentivizes moving towards the landing pad, but the `angle_stability` term penalizes tilting, making it easier for the agent to stabilize its orientation. The `angular_velocity_penalty` encourages gentle movements by penalizing high angular velocities.

The `velocity_reward` now discourages high speeds during the landing process, while still allowing a gentle approach. This should help the lander come to rest safely and efficiently.
