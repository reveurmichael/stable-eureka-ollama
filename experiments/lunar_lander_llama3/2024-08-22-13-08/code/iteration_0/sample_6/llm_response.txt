Here's an alternative to the initial reward proposal. The main idea is to incentivize the lander to stay near the center of the landing pad, slow down its velocity, and not use the main engine too much.

```Python
def compute_reward(self, state, action, next_state, terminated):
    # Unpack state variables
    x, y, vx, vy, angle, angular_velocity, left_leg, right_leg = state

    # Distance-based reward: incentivize moving towards the landing pad center
    distance_reward = -np.sqrt((x-0.5)**2 + (y-self.helipad_y-LEG_DOWN/SCALE)**2)
    distance_reward = np.exp(distance_reward / 100.0) - 1

    # Velocity-based reward: penalize high velocities and incentivize slowing down
    velocity_penalty = -(np.abs(vx) + np.abs(vy)) ** 2
    velocity_penalty = np.tanh(velocity_penalty / 5.0)

    # Fuel efficiency reward: penalize using the main engine (s_power)
    fuel_penalty = -1 if action == 2 else 0

    # Landing reward: bonus for successful landing
    landing_reward = 0
    if left_leg and right_leg:
        landing_reward = 100 if abs(x) < 0.05 and abs(y) < 0.05 else 10

    # Total reward: a weighted sum of all components
    reward = (distance_reward
              + 0.5 * velocity_penalty
              + 0.1 * fuel_penalty
              + landing_reward)

    # Apply a penalty if the episode is terminated (crash or out of bounds)
    if terminated and not (left_leg and right_leg):
        reward -= 100

    individual_reward = {
        "distance_reward": distance_reward,
        "velocity_penalty": velocity_penalty,
        "fuel_penalty": fuel_penalty,
        "landing_reward": landing_reward,
    }

    return reward, individual_reward
```

This variation rewards the lander for staying close to the center of the landing pad and slowing down its velocity. It also penalizes the use of the main engine (s_power) to encourage more efficient flights. The landing reward is still present but slightly reduced from the initial proposal to make it less dominant.
