Here's a variation of the initial reward proposal:

```
def compute_reward(self, state, m_power, s_power, terminated):
    # Unpack state variables
    x, y, vx, vy, angle, angular_velocity, left_leg, right_leg = state

    # Distance-based reward: incentivize moving towards the landing pad
    distance_reward = -np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    distance_reward = np.exp(distance_reward / 100.0) - 1

    # Stability reward: penalize tilting and angular velocity
    angle_penalty = -np.abs(angle)
    angle_penalty = np.tanh(angle_penalty / 0.5)

    angular_velocity_penalty = -np.abs(angular_velocity)
    angular_velocity_penalty = np.tanh(angular_velocity_penalty / 0.5)

    # Velocity reward: penalize high velocities
    velocity_penalty = -(np.abs(vx) + np.abs(vy))
    velocity_penalty = np.tanh(velocity_penalty / 1.0)

    # Main engine efficiency reward: incentivize using the main engine
    m_engine_efficiency = -m_power if m_power > 0 else 0

    # Side engines efficiency reward: incentivize using side engines
    s_engine_efficiency = -s_power if s_power > 0 else 0

    # Landing reward: bonus for successful landing
    landing_reward = 0
    if left_leg and right_leg:
        landing_reward = 100 if abs(x) < 0.1 and abs(y) < 0.1 else 10

    # Total reward: a weighted sum of all components
    reward = (distance_reward
              + 0.05 * angle_penalty
              + 0.05 * angular_velocity_penalty
              + 0.3 * velocity_penalty
              + 0.2 * m_engine_efficiency
              + 0.4 * s_engine_efficiency
              + landing_reward)

    # Apply a penalty if the episode is terminated (crash or out of bounds)
    if terminated and not (left_leg and right_leg):
        reward -= 100

    individual_reward = {
        "distance_reward": distance_reward,
        "angle_penalty": angle_penalty,
        "angular_velocity_penalty": angular_velocity_penalty,
        "velocity_penalty": velocity_penalty,
        "m_engine_efficiency": m_engine_efficiency,
        "s_engine_efficiency": s_engine_efficiency,
        "landing_reward": landing_reward,
    }

    return reward, individual_reward
```

In this variation, I've added separate rewards for main engine efficiency and side engines efficiency. The main engine is incentivized to be used more often (negative reward for using the main engine), while the side engines are also incentivized to be used (negative reward for not using the side engines).
