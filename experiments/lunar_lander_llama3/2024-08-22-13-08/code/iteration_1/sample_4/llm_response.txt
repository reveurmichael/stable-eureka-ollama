A reinforcement learning problem!

Based on the provided code, I'm going to take a stab at writing an effective reward function.

**Assumptions**

1. The goal is to land the lander safely and efficiently.
2. The reward function should encourage good landing practices, such as:
	* Staying close to the target (helipad) while reducing velocity.
	* Maintaining a stable orientation (angle).
	* Avoiding crashes or significant impacts.

**Reward Function**

Here's a possible reward function:
```python
def compute_reward(state, m_power, s_power, terminated):
    # Positive rewards for good landing practices
    angle_penalty = -0.1 * np.abs(state[4])  # penalize large angles
    velocity_reward = -0.05 * (state[2] ** 2 + state[3] ** 2)  # encourage low velocities
    distance_reward = 0.5 * (1.0 - np.abs(state[0]))  # reward proximity to target

    # Penalty for crashes or significant impacts
    crash_penalty = -10.0 if terminated else 0.0

    individual_reward = angle_penalty + velocity_reward + distance_reward + crash_penalty

    return individual_reward, {'angle': angle_penalty, 'velocity': velocity_reward, 'distance': distance_reward}
```
**Explanation**

1. The reward function is composed of three main components: `angle_penalty`, `velocity_reward`, and `distance_reward`.
2. The `angle_penalty` term encourages the lander to maintain a stable orientation by penalizing large angles.
3. The `velocity_reward` term rewards low velocities, which indicates successful landing.
4. The `distance_reward` term provides a positive reward for staying close to the target (helipad).
5. The `crash_penalty` term is a significant penalty if the lander crashes or experiences a significant impact.

This reward function should provide a good balance between encouraging good landing practices and penalizing poor ones.
