Based on the provided code, the reward function seems to be a combination of two types of rewards: `individual_reward` and `fitness_score`. The individual reward might depend on the state of the lander (position, velocity, orientation, etc.) as well as the actions taken by the agent (main engine power and side engine power). 

The fitness score is likely related to the overall performance of the agent in a given episode. It could be based on metrics such as reaching the helipad safely, or achieving a certain level of altitude.

Here's how you can reflect the reward function:

```
def compute_reward(self, state, m_power, s_power, terminated):
    # Calculate individual reward
    individual_reward = -abs(state[0])  # penalty for distance from target

    if not terminated:
        # bonus for being close to the helipad or in a safe position
        if abs(state[1]) < 0.5 and state[4] < 0.2:  # adjust these values as needed
            individual_reward += 1.0

    return individual_reward, {'fitness_score': self.compute_fitness_score(state, m_power, s_power, terminated)}

def compute_fitness_score(self, state, m_power, s_power, terminated):
    # Define the fitness score based on metrics such as:
    # - Reaching the helipad safely
    # - Achieving a certain level of altitude
    # - Minimizing distance traveled

    if not terminated and abs(state[0]) < 0.5:  # adjust these values as needed
        return 1.0

    return 0.0
