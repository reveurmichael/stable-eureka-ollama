Based on the provided code, I'll reflect on the current reward function and suggest improvements. The goal is to create an impact on the physics, not just render them.

The reward function seems to be based on the state variables (position, velocity, angle, angular velocity), as well as the game over status and legs' ground contact. 

However, without more information about the desired behavior of the lander in this environment, it's difficult to provide a specific reward function that would encourage good performance.

One possible approach could be to use a combination of rewards for different aspects of the task:

- Positional reward: Reward for being close to the target position (e.g., the helipad).
- Velocity-based reward: Encourage low velocity, especially near the ground.
- Angle and angular velocity reward: Incentivize smooth landing and stable orientation.

Here's a simple example of how this could be implemented:

```
def compute_reward(state, m_power, s_power, terminated):
    reward = 0.0

    # Positional reward
    distance_to_target = np.linalg.norm(np.array([state[0], state[1]]) - target_position)
    reward += -distance_to_target / max_distance

    # Velocity-based reward
    if state[2] < low_velocity_threshold:
        reward += velocity_reward

    # Angle and angular velocity reward
    reward += -np.abs(state[4]) / angle_threshold
    if np.abs(state[5]) < low_angular_velocity_threshold:
        reward += angular_velocity_reward

    # Terminal rewards
    if terminated:
        if state[0] >= 1.0:  # Landed successfully
            reward = terminal_success_reward
        else:  # Game over, but didn't land
            reward = terminal_failure_reward

    return reward, {'pos': distance_to_target, 'vel': state[2], 'angle': state[4]}
```

Please note that these rewards are just examples and may need to be adjusted based on the specific requirements of your environment.
