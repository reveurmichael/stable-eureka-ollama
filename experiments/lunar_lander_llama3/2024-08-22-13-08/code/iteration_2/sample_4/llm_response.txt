Based on the provided code, I would suggest a reward function that encourages the agent to successfully land the lander while avoiding penalties for falling too far or not moving at all. Here's a possible reward reflection:

`reward = -m_power * (1 - (state[0] + state[2]) / VIEWPORT_W) - s_power * abs(state[3]) + 10.0 * (1 - (state[4] ** 2))`

* `-m_power * (1 - (state[0] + state[2]) / VIEWPORT_W)` penalizes the agent for not moving towards the center of the viewport, with a higher penalty for being farther away.
* `-s_power * abs(state[3])` penalizes the agent for having high vertical velocity, which is undesirable since it may indicate that the lander is falling too fast.
* `+ 10.0 * (1 - (state[4] ** 2))` rewards the agent for keeping its angle close to zero, indicating a stable and controlled landing.

This reward function aims to balance the need for movement and control with the goal of successfully landing the lander while minimizing the use of side engines. The `individual_reward.update({'fitness_score': fitness_score})` line suggests that the fitness score is also used as part of the individual reward, so this could be incorporated into the overall reward function as well.

Note that this is just one possible approach to designing a reward function, and you may need to adjust or modify it based on your specific environment and goals.
