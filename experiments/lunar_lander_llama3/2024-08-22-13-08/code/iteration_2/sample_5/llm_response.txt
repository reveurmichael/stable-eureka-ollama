Based on the provided code, the current reward function is not explicitly defined. However, I can infer that there are two main parts to the reward calculation:

1. `compute_reward(state, m_power, s_power, terminated)` calculates the overall reward.
2. `compute_fitness_score(state, m_power, s_power, terminated)` calculates a fitness score.

The reward function is likely dependent on the state of the lander (position, velocity, angle, and angular velocity), as well as any relevant information from the previous actions (m_power and s_power).

Here's a possible reflection of the current reward code:

```
def compute_reward(self, state, m_power, s_power, terminated):
    # Calculate reward based on state
    reward = 0.0
    
    # Reward for reaching the landing site or being close to it?
    if abs(state[0]) < 0.5 and abs(state[1]) < 0.5:
        reward += 10.0
    
    # Penalty for crashing or being too high?
    if terminated or state[0] > 1.0 or state[1] > 1.0:
        reward -= 50.0
    
    # Reward for proper orientation and position?
    if abs(state[2]) < 0.5 and abs(state[3]) < 0.5 and abs(state[4]) < 0.5:
        reward += 10.0
    
    return reward, {}
```

This is just a simple example of how the reward function could be implemented. The actual code would depend on the specific requirements and constraints of the problem.
