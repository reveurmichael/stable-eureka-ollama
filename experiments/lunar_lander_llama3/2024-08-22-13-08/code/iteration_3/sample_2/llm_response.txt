A reinforcement learning problem!

The reward function is defined as:
```
reward, individual_reward = self.compute_reward(state, m_power, s_power, terminated)
```
However, I don't see the implementation of `self.compute_reward()` or `compute_fitness_score()`. It seems like you're missing some code.

Assuming these functions are implemented elsewhere in your codebase, here's a possible reward reflection:

**Reward Reflection:**

The reward function is designed to encourage the agent to reach the helipad while minimizing the cost of reaching it. The reward structure consists of:

1. **Reaching the helipad**: A positive reward for landing on the helipad (e.g., +10).
2. **Distance penalty**: A negative reward for being far from the helipad (e.g., -0.1 per unit distance).
3. **Action cost**: A small negative reward for taking an action (e.g., -0.01 per action).

The individual reward `individual_reward` is a dictionary that stores additional information, such as the fitness score.

**Reward Code:**
```python
def compute_reward(state, m_power, s_power, terminated):
    # Calculate distance from helipad
    distance = np.linalg.norm(state[:2])

    # Calculate reaching helipad reward
    if terminated:
        return 10.0, {"fitness_score": state[-1]}  # LANDED!

    # Penalty for being far from helipad
    penalty = -0.1 * distance

    # Action cost (small negative reward)
    action_cost = -0.01

    # Combine rewards
    reward = penalty + action_cost
    return reward, {"fitness_score": state[-1]}
```
This is just a possible implementation of the reward function. The actual reward calculation may vary depending on your specific problem requirements and constraints.
