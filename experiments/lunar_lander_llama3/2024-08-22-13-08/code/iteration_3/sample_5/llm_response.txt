A reinforcement learning problem!

From the given code, I can infer that the reward function should reflect the progress towards a goal state. In this case, the goal might be to successfully land the rover on the helipad.

Here's my proposed reward code:
```python
def compute_reward(state, m_power, s_power, terminated):
    # Define constants for reward shaping
    LANDING_BONUS = 10.0
    VELOCITY_PENALTY = -1.0
    ANGLE_PENALTY = -0.5

    # Calculate the distance to the helipad
    helipad_distance = np.linalg.norm(state[:2]) - (self.helipad_y + LEG_DOWN / SCALE)

    # Reward for landing close to the helipad
    if terminated and helipad_distance < 0.1:
        return LANDING_BONUS, {'landing_bonus': LANDING_BONUS}

    # Penalty for high velocity
    vel_penalty = VELOCITY_PENALTY * np.linalg.norm(state[2:4])

    # Penalty for large angle deviation from the vertical
    angle_penalty = ANGLE_PENALTY * abs(state[4])

    # Combine rewards and penalties
    reward = -vel_penalty - angle_penalty

    return reward, {'velocity_penalty': vel_penalty, 'angle_penalty': angle_penalty}
```
The reward function consists of three components:

1. **Landing bonus**: If the lander successfully lands close to the helipad (within a small radius), it receives a significant positive reward.
2. **Velocity penalty**: The higher the velocity of the lander, the more negative the reward becomes. This encourages the agent to control its speed and trajectory.
3. **Angle penalty**: Large deviations from the vertical orientation (i.e., large angles) result in negative rewards, encouraging the agent to maintain a stable attitude.

The individual reward dictionary provides additional information about the reward components for debugging purposes.
