Based on the provided code, I would suggest a reward function that takes into account the state and actions taken by the agent. Here's a possible implementation:

```
def compute_reward(state, m_power, s_power, terminated):
    # Define reward parameters
    LANDING_REWARD = 1.0
    CRASH_PENALTY = -1.0
    ORIENTATION_PENALTY = -0.5
    VELOCITY_PENALTY = -0.2

    # Calculate the distance from the center of the viewport to the lander's x position
    pos_x = (state[0] + 1) * VIEWPORT_W / SCALE / 2

    # Calculate the reward based on the state and actions
    if terminated:
        if self.game_over:  # Lander has crashed or fallen off the platform
            return CRASH_PENALTY, {'crash': True}
        elif abs(state[0]) >= 1.0:  # Lander is too far from the center of the viewport
            return ORIENTATION_PENALTY, {'orientation': True}
    else:
        if pos_x > VIEWPORT_W / SCALE / 2 - 0.5 * VIEWPORT_W / SCALE / 2:  # Lander has landed on the platform
            return LANDING_REWARD, {'landing': True}
        elif m_power > 0 or s_power > 0:  # Agent is still moving or using engines
            return VELOCITY_PENALTY, {'velocity': True}

    # If none of the above conditions are met, assume a neutral reward
    return 0.0, {}
```

This reward function takes into account the distance from the center of the viewport to the lander's x position (pos_x), which can be used as an indicator of orientation and landing success. The function also considers the usage of engines (m_power and s_power) and whether the agent has crashed or fallen off the platform.
