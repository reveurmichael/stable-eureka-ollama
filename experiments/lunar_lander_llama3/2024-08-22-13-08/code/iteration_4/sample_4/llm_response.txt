A reinforcement learning problem!

To create a good reward function, I'll reflect on the environment and the goal. It seems that the agent (the lander) needs to navigate to a target location (the helipad) while avoiding falling off or crashing.

From the code, I can see that the state includes:

* Lander's position (x, y)
* Velocity (vx, vy)
* Orientation (angle)
* Angular velocity
* Leg contact status (0/1 for each leg)

The reward function should encourage the agent to stay close to the target location while keeping it upright and avoiding crashes. Here's a possible reward code:

```
def compute_reward(state, m_power, s_power, terminated):
    # Define constants
    TARGET_RADIUS = 5  # Radius around the helipad where the lander is considered successful
    CRASH_PENALTY = -100  # Penalty for crashing or falling off
    ORIENTATION_BONUS = 10  # Bonus for maintaining a stable orientation
    VELOCITY_PENALTY = -1  # Penalty for high velocity (to encourage slow and steady descent)

    reward = 0

    # Check if the lander is close to the target location
    distance_to_helipad = np.sqrt((state[0] - VIEWPORT_W / SCALE / 2) ** 2 + (state[1] - self.helipad_y - LEG_DOWN / SCALE) ** 2)
    if distance_to_helipad <= TARGET_RADIUS:
        reward += 10

    # Check for crashes or falls
    if terminated:
        reward = CRASH_PENALTY

    # Encourage stable orientation
    if np.abs(state[4]) < 0.5:  # Assuming the lander is considered upright if its angle is within 30 degrees of horizontal
        reward += ORIENTATION_BONUS

    # Penalty for high velocity
    if state[2] ** 2 + state[3] ** 2 > 100:  # Assuming a high velocity threshold (e.g., above 10 m/s)
        reward += VELOCITY_PENALTY

    return reward, {}
```

This reward function encourages the agent to stay close to the target location while maintaining a stable orientation and avoiding crashes. The individual reward dictionary is left empty for now, as the fitness score calculation seems to be handled separately.
