Based on the provided code, I would reflect the following reward function:

```
def compute_reward(self, state, m_power, s_power, terminated):
    # The lander's position and velocity are used to calculate a reward
    pos_x = (state[0] + VIEWPORT_W / SCALE / 2) / (VIEWPORT_W / SCALE / 2)
    pos_y = (state[1] + self.helipad_y + LEG_DOWN / SCALE) / (VIEWPORT_H / SCALE / 2)
    
    # The reward is a function of the distance to the target and the speed
    reward = -((pos_x**2) + (pos_y**2)) - m_power * 0.1
    if terminated:
        reward -= 10.0
    
    return reward, {'main_engine': m_power, 'side_engine': s_power}
```

This reward function aims to guide the agent towards the target by minimizing the distance to it while penalizing excessive speed and movement in all directions. The `m_power` and `s_power` values are used to calculate a more nuanced reward that takes into account the different types of engines being used.
