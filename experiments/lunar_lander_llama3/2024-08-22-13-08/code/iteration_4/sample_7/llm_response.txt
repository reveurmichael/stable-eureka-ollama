Based on the provided environment and the goal to create impact on the physics, I assume that the main objective is to control the lander's movement and orientation to successfully land on the helipad. 

Here is a possible reward function:

```
def compute_reward(self, state, m_power, s_power, terminated):
    # Reward for successful landing
    if not terminated:
        reward = -5 * np.abs(state[0])  # penalty for distance from center

    # Additional reward for decreasing altitude (closer to the helipad)
    elif state[1] < 0.3: 
        reward = 100
    else:
        reward = -10

    if terminated and not self.game_over:
        reward -= 100  # punishment for game over without landing successfully

    individual_reward = {
        'distance': np.abs(state[0]),
        'altitude': state[1],
        'orientation': np.abs(state[4]), 
        'angular_velocity': np.abs(state[5]), 
        'fitness_score': self.fitness_score
    }
    return reward, individual_reward
```

This reward function aims to:

- Reward the agent for successfully landing on the helipad.
- Penalize the agent for being far from the center of the viewport.
- Encourage the agent to decrease its altitude (get closer to the helipad).
- Punish the agent for game over without successfully landing.

The individual reward dictionary provides more detailed information about the agent's performance.
