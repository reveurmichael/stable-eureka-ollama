The reward function output should include:
1. Total reward (float)
2. Dictionary of individual reward components
Format as a Python code string: "```python ... ```". Tips:
1. Normalize rewards using transformations like np.exp. Introduce temperature parameters for each transformation.
2. Ensure input types match expected types.
3. Use only self. attributes from the environment class definition and input variables.
4. No new input variables.
5. The python code must begin with: "```python ... ```"
6. Pass self as the first argument.
7. Do not compute fitness_score components.
8. Only create the reward function, do not create more functions.
9. Try to make everything smooth (when possible).
Provide the function code only, followed by a brief explanation (max 50 words).
