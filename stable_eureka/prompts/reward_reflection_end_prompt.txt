Please analyze the policy feedback and provide an improved reward function to better solve the task. Tips for analyzing feedback:
1. If a reward component's values are nearly identical:
    a. Change its scale or temperature parameter.
    b. Re-write the component.
    c. Discard the component.
2. If a component's magnitude is significantly larger, re-scale it.
3. You want to maximize the fitness score as it is the ground truth evaluator.
Analyze each existing reward component first, then write the new reward function code proposal.
